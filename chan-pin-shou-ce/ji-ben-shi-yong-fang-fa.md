# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version URL: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system and email, which can also easily complete the registration. Please note that when logging in via email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam folder.

At the same time, a lightweight demo can also be experienced in the Telegram bot with the most basic question and answer function. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers a variety of registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, use a web2 account system, or directly register via email + verification code.

After successfully registering through a non-Web3 method, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Dialogue

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key to start recording and then end recording. After the text message is entered, you can send it by clicking the Enter shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory
