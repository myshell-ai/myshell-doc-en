## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

1. **What is [Domain Noun]?**
   [Domain Noun] is a specific term or concept used within a particular field or industry. It is important to leave these terms in their original form, as they may not have a direct translation or may lose their meaning when translated.

2. **How do I maintain the original format?**
   When translating a text written in markdown or HTML, it is essential to keep the original formatting, such as headings, bullet points, and links. This ensures that the translated content remains easy to read and navigate.

3. **Should I translate the English words in the original text?**
   If you encounter English words in the original text, you can leave them as they are, unless they are part of a sentence that needs to be translated. In that case, translate the rest of the sentence while keeping the English word intact.

4. **What if I don't know the meaning of an unusual or domain-specific noun?**
   If you come across a term that you are unfamiliar with, it is best to leave it in its original form. This ensures that the meaning of the term is not lost in translation.

5. **How do I avoid exporting any Chinese?**
   When translating a text, make sure not to include any Chinese characters in the final output. This ensures that the translated content is exclusively in English and maintains its original meaning.

### Formatting Questions

1. **How do I retain the original format in markdown?**
   To maintain the original format in markdown, pay close attention to the syntax used, such as headings (indicated by '#' symbols), bullet points (indicated by '*' or '-' symbols), and links (indicated by '[]()' syntax). Ensure that these elements are preserved in the translated content.

2. **How do I retain the original format in HTML?**
   When translating HTML content, it is crucial to keep the original tags and attributes intact. This includes headings (indicated by '<h1>', '<h2>', etc.), lists (indicated by '<ul>', '<ol>', and '<li>'), and links (indicated by '<a href="...">'). By preserving these elements, the translated content will maintain its original structure and appearance.

### Translation Tips

1. **How do I ensure the accuracy of my translations?**
   To guarantee the accuracy of your translations, it is essential to have a strong understanding of both the source and target languages. Additionally, conducting research on domain-specific terms and concepts can help ensure that the translation accurately conveys the intended meaning.

2. **What tools can I use to assist with translation?**
   There are numerous translation tools available, such as online dictionaries, glossaries, and translation software. These resources can help you better understand unfamiliar terms and provide suggestions for translations. However, it is essential to use these tools as a supplement to your translation skills, rather than relying solely on them for accurate translations.
