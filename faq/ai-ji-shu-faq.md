# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is OpenAI used for voice recognition? Is the Whisper API used?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which has a higher accuracy rate compared to Whisper if you have made a comparison.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4?

Most of the Q&A part of the robot is currently based on ChatGPT-3.5, and we have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS model (text-to-speech). Currently, our English TTS supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, our technology for different emotional tones is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
