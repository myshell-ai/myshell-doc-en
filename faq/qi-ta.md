#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, is the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram could no longer meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for new users to quickly experience and will be limited to fewer interactions. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP version will definitely be released. We are looking for a balance between user experience and content review. The content review boundaries for AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we have seen are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution to provide some services as a fallback option.

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of a valid invitation?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution value of this invitation will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have much exposure, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve it.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite, who have some specific behavioral characteristics, and are judged as valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for judging will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in your series of accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed to access.
