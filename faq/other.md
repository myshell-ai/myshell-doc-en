#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our Telegram bot, was our first demo bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demands for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for new users to quickly experience and will be limited to fewer conversation counts. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation counts? How to remove the conversation count limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation counts, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-rights.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-rights.md "mention")

#### What is an effective invitation? What are the benefits of an effective invitation?

Effective invitation is the most direct way of community contribution. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this measure will be traced back to the three layers after the effective invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will have an impact on this.

An effective invitation refers to the registered user you invite, who has some specific behavioral characteristics and is considered an effective invitation.

To prevent cheating, the rules for determining effective invitations will not be published. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed to access.
