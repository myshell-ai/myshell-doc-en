#### What is the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for a quick experience for new users and limited to fewer conversation times. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we have seen are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove conversation time restrictions? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md "mention")

#### What is an effective invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple effective invitations?

Effective invitation is the most direct way of community contribution. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution value of this will be traced back to three levels after the effective invitation, so even if you do not have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent actions, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

An effective invitation refers to the registered users you invite, who have some specific behavioral characteristics, and are judged as effective invitations.

In order to prevent cheating, the judging rules will not be published. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts and devices being BANned and no longer allowed to access.
