#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grows, Telegram can no longer meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

After the web version is gradually improved, the Telegram bot will be positioned for a quick experience for new users and limited to fewer conversation times. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC in various countries are still unclear, and the AI capabilities we have seen are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove conversation time restrictions? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being improved gradually. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-rights-(tbd).md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-rights-(tbd).md "mention")

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple valid invitations?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this indicator will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will have a positive impact on this.

A valid invitation refers to registered users you invite who have specific behavioral characteristics and are considered valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for judgment will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may lead to a series of your accounts and devices being BANned and no longer allowed to access.
