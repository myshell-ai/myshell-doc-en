#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, is the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grows, Telegram gradually fails to meet the needs of our users. Therefore, we developed the web version.

The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a backup.
