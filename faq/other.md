#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grows, Telegram can no longer meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for a quick experience for new users and limited to a smaller number of conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The regulatory boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a backup.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to lift the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a charge?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction benefits.

Our membership system is still being improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-rights.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-rights.md "mention")

#### What is an effective invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple effective invitations?

Effective invitations are the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is often given priority. The contribution value of this indicator will be traced back to three levels after the effective invitation, so even if you don't have much exposure, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will have an improvement on this.

An effective invitation refers to the registered users you invite who have specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as effective invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for judging will not be announced. If there are too many cases of cheating, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating may result in a series of your accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed to access.

#### Is there more information about the project?

Docs ([https://docs.myshell.ai/](https://docs.myshell.ai/)) provides introductions to various aspects of the project and is constantly updated. You can visit it for more information.

#### After inputting two voice messages, it prompts that the voice cannot be collected. How to solve?

Please check if you are using an IOS device. Due to IOS security policy issues, you need to re-authorize the web page's recording permission regularly. Please try refreshing the page and agree to the authorization in the pop-up notification. If the problem still persists, it is recommended to use it on a desktop.
