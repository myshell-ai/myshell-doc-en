#### What is the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the starting point of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grows, Telegram gradually fails to meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, Telegram's bot will be positioned for new users' quick experience and limited to fewer conversation times. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove conversation time restrictions? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being gradually improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(beta).md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(beta).md "mention")

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple valid invitations?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually given priority. This contribution score measurement will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always occupy some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

A valid invitation refers to registered users you invite who have specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the judging rules will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts and devices being BANned and no longer allowed access.
