#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, was the starting point for our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems increased, Telegram gradually could not meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

As the web version is gradually improved, the Telegram bot will be positioned for the quick experience of new users and limited to fewer conversation times. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP version will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The regulatory boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(beta).md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(beta).md "mention")

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of a valid invitation?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually considered first. The contribution value of this indicator will be traced back to three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

A valid invitation refers to registered users you invite who have specific behavioral characteristics and are considered valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for determining valid invitations will not be published. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. Cheating behavior may also result in your series of accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed to access.
