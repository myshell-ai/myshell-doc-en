#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for quick experience for new users and limited to fewer conversation times. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be released, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC in various countries are still unclear, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version, as a temporary solution, can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove conversation time restrictions? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being improved, and specific methods can be found in [membership-system-and-robot-rights.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-rights.md "mention")

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of a valid invitation?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first priority. The contribution value of this measure will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite who have some specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts and devices being BANned and no longer allowed to access.
