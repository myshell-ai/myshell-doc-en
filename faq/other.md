#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

As the web version is gradually improved, Telegram's bot will be positioned for quick experience for new users and limited to fewer conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a guarantee.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove conversation limits? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

#### What is an effective invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple effective invitations?

Effective invitation is the most direct way of community contribution. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this indicator will be traced back to the three layers after the effective invitation, so even if you don't have much exposure, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior. More product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

An effective invitation refers to the registered users you invite, who have some specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as effective invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for judgment will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may lead to your series of accounts and devices being BAN, no longer allowing access.
