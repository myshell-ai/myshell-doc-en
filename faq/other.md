#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the starting point of our entire project. However, as the requirements for auxiliary functions and membership systems become higher, Telegram gradually fails to meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

After the web version is gradually improved, Telegram's bot will be positioned for the quick experience of new users and limited to fewer conversation times. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation time limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of a valid invitation?

A valid invitation is the most direct way of community contribution. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually given priority. The contribution value of this measure will be traced back to three layers after the valid invitation. Therefore, even if you do not have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always occupy some advantages. At the same time, the contribution value of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will have an improvement.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite, with some specific behavioral characteristics, which are judged as valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the judging rules will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may cause your series of accounts and devices to be BANned and no longer allowed to access.
