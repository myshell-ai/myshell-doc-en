#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems increased, Telegram gradually failed to meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, Telegram's bot will be positioned for quick experiences for new users and will be limited to fewer conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version, as a temporary measure, will provide some services as a guarantee.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation time limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of a valid invitation?

Valid invitations are the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this measure will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have much exposure, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will enhance this.

A valid invitation refers to registered users you invite who have specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for judgment will not be published. If there is too much cheating, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating may result in your series of accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed to access.
