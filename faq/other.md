#### What's the difference between the Telegram Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, was the starting point for our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

As the web version becomes more and more complete, the Telegram bot will be positioned for new users to quickly experience and will be limited to fewer conversation times. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The regulatory boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove conversation time limits? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being improved, and specific methods can be found in [membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md "mention")

#### What is an effective invitation? What are the benefits of an effective invitation?

Effective invitation is the most direct way of community contribution. When community incentive measures are implemented, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this metric will be traced back to the three layers after the effective invitation, so even if you don't have many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

An effective invitation refers to the registered users you invite, who have some specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as effective invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for judgment will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed to access.

#### Is there more information about the project?

Docs ([https://docs.myshell.ai/](https://docs.myshell.ai/)) provides an introduction to various aspects of the project and is constantly updated. You can visit the site for more information.
