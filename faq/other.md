#### What is the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, is the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for a quick experience for new users and will be limited to a smaller number of conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.
