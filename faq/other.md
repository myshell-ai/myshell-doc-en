#### What's the difference between the Telegram Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, was the starting point for our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram could no longer meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for quick experiences for new users and limited to fewer conversation counts. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The regulatory boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation counts? How to remove conversation count restrictions? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation counts, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md "mention")
