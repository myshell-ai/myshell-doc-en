#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the starting point of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grows, Telegram can no longer meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

After the web version is gradually improved, the Telegram bot will be positioned for quick experience for new users and limited to fewer conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of a valid invitation?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution value of this metric will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite who have some specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules of judgment will not be published. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts and devices being BANNED and no longer allowed to access.
