#### What's the difference between Telegram Bot and the web version?

Our Telegram Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for a quick experience for new users and limited to fewer conversation counts. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. So the web version, as a temporary solution, can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation counts? How to remove the conversation count limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation counts, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being improved, for specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-rights-(tbd).md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-rights-(tbd).md "mention")

#### Can I play with Discord and Bot?

Currently, Discord does not have voice information, so only a customer service support robot [#ethan-or-support](../product-manual/robot-introduction.md#ethan-or-support "mention") is provided.

#### How to get MyShell Genesis Pass?

There are several ways to get one of the limited 10,000 MyShell Genesis Passes:

1. Participate in the White List activities of Web3 cooperative communities. These activities will be announced in the Discord channels and can also be found in [ðŸŽ‰-events](../ðŸŽ‰-events/ "mention");
2. Participate in community contribution tasks. These tasks will be posted in the Apply-to-join channel in Discord or in the builders channel. The builders channel requires an introduction in the Apply-to-join channel and approval. These tasks include internal testing, secondary creation, retweeting, etc. Depending on the difficulty of the task, different rules may apply, such as a lottery or direct distribution;
3. Purchase through community inquiries or wait for future NFT platform purchases.

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple valid invitations?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score will be traced back to three levels after a valid invitation, so even if you don't have much exposure, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

A valid invitation refers to a registered user you invite who has specific behavioral characteristics and is deemed a valid invitation.

To prevent cheating, the rules for determining valid invitations will not be published. If there are too many cases of cheating, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating may lead to a series of your accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed to access.

#### Is there more information about the project?

Docs ([https://docs.myshell.ai/](https://docs.myshell.ai/)) provides an introduction to various aspects of the project and is constantly updated. You can visit it for more information.
