#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet the needs of our users, so we developed a web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for new users' quick experience and limited to fewer conversation times. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched as we look for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove conversation time restrictions? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction benefits.

Our membership system is still being improved, and specific methods can be found in [membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md "mention")

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple valid invitations?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community, and when the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution value measurement of this will be traced back to three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always occupy some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will have an improvement on this.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite, who have some specific behavioral characteristics, which are judged as valid invitations.

In order to prevent cheating, the judging rules will not be published. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts/devices being BANned and no longer allowed to access.
