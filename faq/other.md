#### What is the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grows, Telegram can no longer meet the needs of our users, so we have developed a web version.

After the web version is gradually improved, the Telegram bot will be positioned for a quick experience for new users and limited to fewer conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we have seen are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction benefits.

Our membership system is still being gradually improved, and specific methods can be found in [membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(tbd).md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(tbd).md "mention")

#### What is an effective invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple effective invitations?

Effective invitations are the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually given priority. The contribution score of this invitation will be traced back to the three layers after the effective invitation. Therefore, even if you don't have many exposure channels, early invitations will always occupy some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

An effective invitation refers to the registered users you invite, who have some specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as effective invitations.

To prevent cheating, the judging rules will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may cause a series of your accounts and devices to be BANned and no longer allowed to access.
