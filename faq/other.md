#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, is the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram could no longer meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.
