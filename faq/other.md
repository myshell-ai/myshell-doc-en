#### What is the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demands for auxiliary functions and membership systems grow, Telegram gradually cannot meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

After the web version is gradually improved, the Telegram bot will be positioned for a quick experience for new users and limited to a smaller number of conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation time limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of a valid invitation?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this metric will be traced back to three levels after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

A valid invitation refers to a registered user you invite who has specific behavioral characteristics and is judged as a valid invitation.

To prevent cheating, the rules will not be published. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may cause your series of accounts and devices to be BANned and no longer allowed to access.
