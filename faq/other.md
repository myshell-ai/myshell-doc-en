#### What are the differences between the Telegram Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our Telegram bot, was our first demo bot and the starting point of our entire project. However, as the requirements for auxiliary functions and membership systems became higher, Telegram gradually could not meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

After the web version is gradually improved, the Telegram bot will be positioned for the quick experience of new users and limited to a smaller number of conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we have seen are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction benefits.

Our membership system is still being improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-rights-(tbd).md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-rights-(tbd).md "mention")

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of multiple valid invitations?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution value of this invitation will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always occupy a certain advantage. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will have an improvement on this.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite, who have some specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for judgment will not be published. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may cause your series of accounts and devices to be BANned and no longer allowed to access.
