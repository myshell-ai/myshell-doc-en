#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the starting point for our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram could no longer meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for quick experiences for new users and limited to fewer interactions. The web version will provide a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched, and we are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The regulatory boundaries of AIGC in various countries are still unclear, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations, so the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction benefits.

Our membership system is still being improved, and specific methods can be found in [membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(beta).md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits-(beta).md "mention")

#### What is an effective invitation? What are the benefits of effective invitations?

Effective invitations are the most direct way to contribute to the community, and when the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this invitation will be traced back to the three layers after the effective invitation, so even if you don't have much exposure, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will have an improvement on this.

An effective invitation refers to the registered users you invite who have specific behavioral characteristics and are considered effective invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for determining will not be published, and if there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating may result in a series of your accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed access.
