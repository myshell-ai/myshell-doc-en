#### What is the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram could no longer meet our user needs, so we developed the web version.

After the web version is gradually improved, the Telegram bot will be positioned for the quick experience of new users and limited to a smaller number of conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a backup.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation time limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of a valid invitation?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this metric will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, early invitations will always occupy a certain advantage. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent actions, and more product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite who have some specific behavioral characteristics and are judged to be valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the judging rules will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating may result in your series of accounts and devices being BANned and no longer allowed to access.
