# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the voice recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology. If you have made comparisons, you would find that its accuracy is higher than Whisper's.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The Q&A part of our robot is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our self-developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation than other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, different emotional voice technologies are in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
