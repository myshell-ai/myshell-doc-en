# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Does it use the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which has a higher accuracy rate than Whisper if you've made comparisons.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4?

Most of the robot's Q&A function is currently based on ChatGPT-3.5. We plan to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. At the same time, our self-developed LLM is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more realistic pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Technology for different emotional voices is currently in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
