# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our self-developed ASR (Automated Speech Recognition). If you have made comparisons, the accuracy is higher than Whisper's.

#### Is the Q&A using GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT3.5 or GPT4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The Q&A part of the robot is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our self-developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Currently, our English TTS supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, the technology for different emotional voices is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
