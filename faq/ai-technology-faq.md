# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We are using our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system. If you have made comparisons, you will find that its accuracy is higher than that of Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A using GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT3.5 or GPT4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The Q&A part of the robot is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) at the moment. We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is already in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We are using our self-developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports fast voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Different emotion voice technologies are currently in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
