# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is OpenAI used for speech recognition? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own in-house ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which, if you have compared, has higher accuracy than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4?

Most of the robot's Q&A function is currently based on ChatGPT-3.5. We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our in-house LLM is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own in-house TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports fast voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Our technology for different emotional voices is currently in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
