# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which has a higher accuracy rate compared to Whisper if you've done comparisons.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4?

Most of the chatbot's Q&A functionality is currently based on ChatGPT-3.5. We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our in-house developed LLM is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own in-house developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural-sounding pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, technology for different emotional voices is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
