# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which, if you have compared, has a higher accuracy rate than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4?

The Q&A part of the robot is mostly based on ChatGPT-3.5. We plan to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features in the future. At the same time, our self-developed LLM is in the experimental stage and will be launched soon.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS (text-to-speech) model. Currently, our English TTS supports fast voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more human-like pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, the technology for different emotional voices is in the experimental stage and will be launched soon.
