# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the whisper API?

We use our self-developed ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system. If you have made comparisons, you will find that its accuracy is higher than that of Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? Is it GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The Q&A part of our robot is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features in the future. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched soon.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our self-developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more realistic pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, our technology for different emotional voices is in the experimental stage and will be launched soon.
