# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system, which, if you have compared, has a higher accuracy than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A using GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT3.5 or GPT4? Is the Q&A model developed in-house?

The majority of the robot's Q&A section is currently based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. At the same time, our in-house LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS (text-to-speech) model. Currently, our English TTS supports fast voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more realistic pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Different emotional speech technologies are currently in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
