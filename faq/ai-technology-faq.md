# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system, which, if you have compared, has a higher accuracy rate than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The Q&A part of the robot is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) at the moment. We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is already in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS model (text-to-speech). Currently, our English TTS supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural-sounding pronunciation than other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. At present, our technology for different emotional voices is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
