# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our in-house developed ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system. If you have compared it, the accuracy is higher than that of Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT3.5 or GPT4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

Most of the robot's Q&A parts are currently based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. At the same time, our in-house developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our in-house developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Currently, our English TTS supports fast voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more realistic pronunciation compared to other products on the market, along with faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, voice technology with different emotions is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
