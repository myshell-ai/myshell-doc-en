# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which, if you have compared, has a higher accuracy than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A using GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT 3.5 or GPT 4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The Q&A part of the robot is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We plan to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. At the same time, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS model (text-to-speech). Currently, our English TTS supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. At present, different emotional voice technologies are in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
