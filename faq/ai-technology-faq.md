# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system, which has a higher accuracy rate compared to Whisper if you've done any comparisons.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The majority of the robot's Q&A section is currently based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our self-developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural-sounding pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Different emotional voice technologies are currently in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
