# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own in-house ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system, which, if you've compared, has a higher accuracy than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? Is it GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The Q&A portion of the robot is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features in the future. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental phase and will be launched soon.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own in-house TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports fast voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation compared to other products on the market, along with faster response times and lower computational costs. The technology for different emotional voices is in the experimental phase and will be launched soon.
