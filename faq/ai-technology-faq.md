# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the voice recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system. If you have compared it with others, you'll find that its accuracy is higher than that of Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

Our chatbot's Q&A component is mostly based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) at the moment. We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS (text-to-speech) model. Currently, our English TTS supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has more natural-sounding pronunciation compared to other products on the market, along with faster response times and lower computational costs. Our technology for different emotional voices is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
