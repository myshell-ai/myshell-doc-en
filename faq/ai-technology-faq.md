# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our self-developed ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) system, which, if you have compared, has a higher accuracy rate than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4?

Most of the robot's Q&A section is currently based on ChatGPT-3.5. We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. At the same time, our self-developed LLM is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our self-developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Currently, our English TTS supports fast voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more human-like pronunciation compared to other products on the market, along with faster response times and lower computational costs. The technology for different emotional voices is currently in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
