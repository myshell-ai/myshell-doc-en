# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology. If you have made a comparison, you will find that our ASR has higher accuracy than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4?

The Q&A part of our AI robot is mostly based on ChatGPT-3.5. We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features in the future. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM is currently in the experimental stage and will be launched soon.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Our technology for different emotional voices is currently in the experimental stage and will be launched soon.
