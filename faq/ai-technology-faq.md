# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is OpenAI used for speech recognition? Is the Whisper API used?

We use our self-developed ASR (Automated Speech Recognition). If you have made a comparison, the accuracy is higher than that of Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT3.5 or GPT4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

Most of the robot's Q&A part is currently based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We plan to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is already in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our self-developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Currently, our English TTS supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more human-like pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, different emotional voice technology is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
