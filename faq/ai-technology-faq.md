# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which, if you've compared, has a higher accuracy than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

Most of the robot's Q&A functions are currently based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We plan to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our self-developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports fast voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more human-like pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Our technology for different emotional voices is currently in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
