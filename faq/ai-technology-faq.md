# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is OpenAI used for speech recognition? Is the Whisper API used?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which, if compared, has a higher accuracy rate than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

Most of the robot's Q&A part is currently based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our self-developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS already supports fast voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, different emotional voice technologies are in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
