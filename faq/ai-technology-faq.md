# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is the speech recognition using OpenAI? Is it using the Whisper API?

We use our in-house developed ASR (Automated Speech Recognition). If you've made comparisons, our ASR has higher accuracy than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A using GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT-3.5 or GPT-4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

Most of the robot's Q&A part is currently based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We have plans to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. At the same time, our in-house developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our in-house developed TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS already supports rapid voice cloning, with just 1-5 minutes of voice samples needed to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has more natural-sounding pronunciation than other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, different emotional voice technologies are in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
