# AI Technology FAQ

#### Is OpenAI used for speech recognition? Is it the Whisper API?

We use our own ASR (Automated Speech Recognition) technology, which, if you have compared, has higher accuracy than Whisper.

#### Is the Q&A based on GPT? Is it based on ChatGPT? GPT3.5 or GPT4? Is the Q&A model self-developed?

The majority of the robot's Q&A section is currently based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). We plan to integrate GPT-4 into some advanced features. Meanwhile, our self-developed LLM (Large Language Model) is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.

#### What model is used for TTS? What are the features of MyShell's TTS?

We use our own TTS model (text-to-speech). Our English TTS currently supports rapid voice cloning, requiring only 1-5 minutes of voice samples to clone anyone's voice.

MyShell's TTS has a more natural pronunciation compared to other products on the market, as well as faster response times and lower computational costs. Currently, technology for different emotional voices is in the experimental stage and will be launched in the near future.
