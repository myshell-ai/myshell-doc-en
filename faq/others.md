#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, is the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary features and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

After the web version is gradually improved, the Telegram bot will be positioned for a quick experience for new users and limited to a smaller number of conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP version will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and content review. The content review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we have seen are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to top up? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction benefits.

Our membership system is still being gradually improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md "mention")
