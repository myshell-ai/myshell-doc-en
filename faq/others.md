#### What is the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, is the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet the needs of our users, so we developed a web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for a quick experience for new users and limited to fewer interactions. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we have seen are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a backup.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove conversation time restrictions? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple valid invitations?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this invitation will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have too many exposure channels, the early invitations will always occupy a certain advantage. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent actions, and more product and on-chain interactions will have an improvement on this.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite who have specific behavioral characteristics and are judged as valid invitations.

In order to prevent cheating, the judging rules will not be announced. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts and devices being BANned and no longer allowed to access.
