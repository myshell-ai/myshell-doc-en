#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Telegram's Samantha is our first Demo Bot and the starting point of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually could not meet the needs of our users, so we developed a web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for quick experiences for new users and limited to fewer conversation times. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

There will definitely be an APP version. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services anyway as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation time limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction benefits.

Our membership system is still being improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-robot-benefits.md "mention")
