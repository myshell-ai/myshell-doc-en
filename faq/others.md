#### What is the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, is the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems has increased, Telegram can no longer meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

After the web version is gradually improved, the Telegram bot will be positioned for quick experience for new users and will be limited to a smaller number of conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we have seen are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version is a temporary solution that can provide some services as a backup.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction rights.

Our membership system is still being improved. For specific methods, please refer to [membership-system-and-bot-benefits.md](../product-manual/membership-system-and-bot-benefits.md "mention")
