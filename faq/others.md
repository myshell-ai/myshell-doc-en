#### What's the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, is the origin of our whole project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually couldn't meet the needs of our users, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, the Telegram bot will be positioned for new users' quick experience and limited to fewer conversations. The web version will carry a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and review. The review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we see are far beyond the control of current laws and regulations. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How to get more conversation times? How to remove the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a paid version?

There is no way to get unlimited conversation times, but by upgrading your membership level, you can get more robot interaction benefits.

Our membership system is still being gradually improved. For specific methods, please refer to [hui-yuan-xi-tong-yu-ji-qi-ren-quan-yi.md](../chan-pin-shou-ce/hui-yuan-xi-tong-yu-ji-qi-ren-quan-yi.md "mention")

#### Can I play with Discord and Bot?

Currently, Discord does not have voice messages, so only customer support robots [#ethan-or-support](../chan-pin-shou-ce/ji-qi-ren-jie-shao.md#ethan-or-support "mention") are provided.

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of having multiple valid invitations?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution score of this invitation will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation, so even if you don't have many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of the invitation will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior, and more product and on-chain interactions will have an improvement on this.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite, who have some specific behavior characteristics and are judged as valid invitations.

In order to prevent cheating, the rules for judging will not be published. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may lead to your series of accounts and devices being BANned and no longer allowed to access.

#### The web version of the App on iOS doesn't play voice messages. How to solve this?

If you are using the built-in Safari browser, we recommend you switch to a third-party browser or go to Website Setting in the Safari browser interface by clicking the AA icon in the bottom left corner, turn off Use Content Blockers, and try again.

#### After entering two voice messages, it prompts that the voice cannot be collected. How to solve this?

Please check if you are using an iOS device. Due to the security policy of iOS, you need to re-authorize the web page's recording permission regularly. Please try refreshing the page and agree to the authorization in the pop-up notification. If the problem persists, we recommend using the desktop version.
