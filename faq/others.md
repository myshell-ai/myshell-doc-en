#### What is the difference between Telegram's Bot and the web version?

Samantha, our first Demo Bot on Telegram, was the origin of our entire project. However, as the demand for auxiliary functions and membership systems grew, Telegram gradually became unable to meet our users' needs, so we developed the web version.

As the web version gradually improves, Telegram's bot will be positioned for new users to quickly experience and will be limited to a smaller number of conversations. The web version will provide a more complete user experience.

#### Will there be an APP version?

An APP will definitely be launched. We are looking for a balance between user experience and content review. The content review boundaries of AIGC are still unclear in various countries, and the AI capabilities we have seen are far beyond what current laws and regulations can control. Therefore, the web version serves as a temporary solution that can provide some services as a fallback.

#### How can I get more conversation times? How to lift the conversation limit? How to get unlimited conversations? How to recharge? Is there a fee?

#### Can I play with Discord and Bot?

#### What is a valid invitation? What are the benefits of a valid invitation?

A valid invitation is the most direct way to contribute to the community. When the community implements incentive measures, this indicator is usually the first to be considered. The contribution value of this metric will be traced back to the three layers after the valid invitation. Therefore, even if you don't have many exposure channels, early invitations will always have some advantages. At the same time, the contribution of invitations will also be traced back to the user's subsequent behavior. More product and on-chain interactions will improve this.

A valid invitation refers to the registered users you invite who have specific behavioral characteristics and are judged to be valid invitations.

To prevent cheating, the rules for judgment will not be disclosed. If there are too many cheating cases, the rules will become stricter and more difficult to figure out. At the same time, cheating behavior may result in a series of your accounts and devices being banned and no longer allowed to access.
