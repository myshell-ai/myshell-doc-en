# Welcome

MyShell ([myshell.ai](http://myshell.ai/)) is an open Web3+AI creation and consumption platform. Users can create various robots on the platform and provide the necessary options for other users.

MyShell started with voice chat robots. We have independently developed powerful automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. MyShell can provide open voice chat messages for robots and users on a one-to-one basis, allowing for closer interaction compared to text-based conversations. Each robot has a unique personality and charming voice, allowing you to treat them as speaking practice partners or relaxing casual conversations. In the future, we will integrate more AI modalities, and these capabilities will also be open to creators on the platform.
