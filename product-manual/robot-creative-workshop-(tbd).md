# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fascinating DIY feature, currently only available to users who own a Genesis PassCard NFT. You can combine interesting Bots in the following ways, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the Bot's role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns.
2. External knowledge base: Let the Bot know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fan fiction, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, can be used by the robot as an external knowledge reserve.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: With 1-5 minutes of audio, you can clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, quick cloning will be available later, but only supports English, other languages are in development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Estimated May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Estimated June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Estimated June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Estimated June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will earn our airdrop (Token). Eventually, the custom robot features will gradually develop into Shell NFTs, and the Bot creators will receive Shell Tokens as economic rewards from user subscriptions.
