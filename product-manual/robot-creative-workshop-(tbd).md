# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

Robot Creative Workshop is a very interesting DIY feature, currently only open to users with MyShell Genesis Pass. You can combine interesting Bots in the following ways, and we encourage everyone to create their own vivid and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of the Bot.
2. External knowledge base: Let the Bot know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fanfictions, blogs, project Docs, or any documents you can think of, can be used as external knowledge reserves by the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, quick cloning will be launched later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Nearly unlimited memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behavior as an advanced interaction with the MyShell platform will receive our airdrop (Token). In addition, the Bot creator will receive Shell Token as an economic return from user subscriptions.
