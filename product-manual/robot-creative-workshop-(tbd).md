# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fascinating DIY feature, currently only available to users with a MyShell Genesis Pass. You can create interesting Bots by combining the following methods, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the Bot's role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns.
2. External Knowledge Base: Let the Bot know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fanfictions, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of can be used as an external knowledge reserve for the robot.
3. Personalized Voiceprint Cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, fast cloning will be available later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modality of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with extra corpus. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will earn our airdrop (Token). In addition, the Bot creator will receive user subscription Shell Tokens as an economic reward.
