# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

Robot Creative Workshop is a very interesting DIY feature, currently only available to users with MyShell Genesis Pass. You can create interesting Bots by combining the following methods, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of the Bot.
2. External knowledge base, allowing the Bot to know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fanfics, blogs, project Docs, or any documents you can think of, can be used as external knowledge reserves for the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Using 1-5 minutes of audio, you can clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, fast cloning will be launched later, but only supports English, and other languages are under development).
4. Nearly unlimited memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will receive our airdrop (Token). In addition, the Bot creator will receive Shell Tokens from user subscriptions as an economic return.
