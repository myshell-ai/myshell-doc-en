# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fascinating DIY feature, currently only available to users with MyShell Genesis Pass. You can create interesting Bots by combining various elements in the following ways, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of your Bot.
2. External knowledge base: Let your Bot know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fanfictions, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, can be used as an external knowledge reserve for the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, quick cloning will be released later, but only supports English, other languages are in development).
4. Near-infinite memory bank. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will earn our airdrop (Token). In addition, the Bot creator will receive Shell Tokens as an economic reward from user subscriptions.
