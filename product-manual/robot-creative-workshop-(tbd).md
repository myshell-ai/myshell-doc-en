# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a very interesting DIY feature, currently only open to users with the Genesis PassCard NFT. You can combine interesting Bots in the following ways, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of the Bot.
2. External knowledge base, allowing the Bot to know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fanfictions, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, can be used as the external knowledge storage for the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, fast cloning will be launched later, but only supports English, other languages ​​are under development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional corpus. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will receive our airdrop (Token). Ultimately, the custom robot features will gradually evolve into Shell NFT, and the Bot creators will receive Shell Tokens as economic rewards from user subscriptions.
