# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fascinating DIY feature that allows you to create interesting Bots by combining various elements. We encourage everyone to create their own vivid and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of your Bot.
2. External knowledge base: Equip your Bot with specific knowledge, such as a series of novels, fan fiction, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, which can be used as an external knowledge reserve.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports a selection of pre-trained TTS, with quick cloning coming later but only supporting English, other languages are in development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities for other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning of additional corpus model training. (Expected in June)

Ultimately, the custom robot features will gradually evolve into Shell NFTs.
