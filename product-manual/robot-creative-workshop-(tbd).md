# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a very interesting DIY feature, currently only available to users with a MyShell Genesis Pass. You can create fun Bots by combining the following features, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize your Bot's role, functions, and even personality and behavior patterns.
2. External knowledge base: Let your Bot know some specific knowledge, such as a series of novels and fan fiction, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, which can be used as an external knowledge reserve for the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, fast cloning will be available later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will earn you our airdrop (Token). In addition, the Bot creator will receive Shell Tokens from user subscriptions as an economic reward.
