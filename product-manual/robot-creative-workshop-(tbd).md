# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fascinating DIY feature that allows you to combine interesting Bots in the following ways. We encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of the Bot.
2. External knowledge base: Let the Bot know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fanfiction, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of can be used as an external knowledge reserve for the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, fast cloning will be launched later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Estimated in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Estimated in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Estimated in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Estimated in June)

Ultimately, the customized robot functions will gradually develop into Shell NFT.
