# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a very interesting DIY feature, currently only available to users with the Genesis PassCard NFT. You can combine interesting Bots in the following ways, and we encourage everyone to create their own vivid and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of the Bot.
2. External knowledge base, allowing the Bot to know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fan fiction, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, can be used as an external knowledge reserve for the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: With 1-5 minutes of audio, you can clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, quick cloning will be available later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Nearly unlimited memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will earn our airdrops (Tokens). Eventually, the custom robot functions will gradually evolve into Shell NFTs, and the Bot creators will receive Shell Tokens as economic rewards from user subscriptions.
