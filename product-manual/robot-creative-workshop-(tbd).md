# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fascinating DIY feature, currently only open to users who own a Genesis PassCard NFT. You can combine interesting Bots in the following ways, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of the Bot.
2. External knowledge base, allowing the Bot to know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fanfiction, blogs, project Docs, or any documents you can think of, can be used as external knowledge reserves for the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, quick cloning will be launched later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will earn our airdrop (Token). Eventually, the customized robot functions will gradually evolve into Shell NFTs, and the Bot creators will receive Shell Tokens from user subscriptions as economic rewards.
