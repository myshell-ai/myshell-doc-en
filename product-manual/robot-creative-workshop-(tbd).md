# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a very interesting DIY feature, currently only available to users with a MyShell Genesis Pass. You can create interesting Bots by combining the following features, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of your Bot.
2. External knowledge base: Let your Bot know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fan fiction, blogs, project Docs, or any documents you can think of, can be used by the robot as an external knowledge reserve.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, fast cloning will be released later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities for other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will earn our airdrop (Token). In addition, the Bot creator will receive Shell Tokens from user subscriptions as an economic return.
