# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fascinating DIY feature, currently only available to users with a Genesis PassCard NFT. You can combine interesting Bots in the following ways, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of the Bot.
2. External knowledge base, allowing the Bot to know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fanfiction, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, can be used by the robot as an external knowledge reserve.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, quick cloning will be available later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Near-infinite memory library. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional corpora. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will receive our airdrop (Token). Eventually, the custom robot features will gradually evolve into Shell NFTs, and the Bot creators will receive Shell Tokens from user subscriptions as economic rewards.
