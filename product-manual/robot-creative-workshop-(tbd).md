# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fascinating DIY feature that allows you to combine interesting Bots in several ways. We encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of your Bot.
2. External Knowledge Base: Let your Bot know some specific knowledge, such as a series of novels and fanfiction, blogs, project Docs, or any other documents you can think of, which can be used as an external knowledge reserve for the robot.
3. Personalized Voiceprint Cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, quick cloning will be available later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Nearly unlimited memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities with other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Ultimately, the customized robot features will gradually evolve into Shell NFT.
