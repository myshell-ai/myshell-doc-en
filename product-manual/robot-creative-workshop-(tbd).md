# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fascinating DIY feature, currently only available to users with a Genesis PassCard NFT. You can combine interesting Bots in the following ways, and we encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the Bot's role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns.
2. External knowledge base, allowing the Bot to know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fan fiction, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, can be used as an external knowledge reserve by the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, fast cloning coming later, but only supports English, other languages are in development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Estimated May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Estimated June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Estimated June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Estimated June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will earn you our airdrops (Token). Eventually, the custom robot features will gradually evolve into Shell NFTs, and Bot creators will receive Shell Tokens from user subscriptions as an economic return.
