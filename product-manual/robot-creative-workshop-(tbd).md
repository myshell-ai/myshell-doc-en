# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a very interesting DIY feature, currently only available to users with MyShell Genesis Pass. You can create interesting Bots by combining the following features, and we encourage everyone to create lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the Bot's role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns.
2. External knowledge base, allowing the Bot to know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fan fiction, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, can be used as an external knowledge reserve for the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, fast cloning will be launched later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Near-infinite memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional corpus. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behavior as an advanced interaction with the MyShell platform will receive our airdrop (Token). In addition, the Bot creator will receive user subscription Shell Tokens as an economic return.
