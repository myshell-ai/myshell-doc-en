# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a fun DIY feature that allows you to create interesting Bots by combining various elements. We encourage everyone to create their own lively and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the Bot's role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns.
2. External Knowledge Base: Equip your Bot with specific knowledge from a variety of sources, such as novels, fan fiction, blogs, project documentation, or any other documents you can think of, which can serve as an external knowledge repository for the robot.
3. Personalized Voiceprint Cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports a selection of pre-trained TTS, with fast cloning coming soon, but only for English. Other languages are under development).
4. Nearly unlimited memory storage. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities with other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Ultimately, the customized robot features will gradually evolve into Shell NFTs.
