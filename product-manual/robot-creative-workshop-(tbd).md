# Robot Creative Workshop (TBD)

The Robot Creative Workshop is a very interesting DIY feature, currently only available to users with a MyShell Genesis Pass. You can combine interesting Bots in the following ways, and we encourage everyone to create their own vivid and entertaining Bots.

1. System Prompt: Customize the role, function, and even personality and behavior patterns of the Bot.
2. External knowledge base: Let the Bot know some specific knowledge, a series of novels and fanfiction, blogs, project Docs, or any document you can think of, can be used as an external knowledge reserve by the robot.
3. Personalized voiceprint cloning: Use 1-5 minutes of audio to clone anyone's voice. (Currently supports selecting some pre-trained TTS, fast cloning will be launched later, but only supports English, other languages are under development).
4. Near-infinite memory bank. (Expected in May)
5. Internet and API access capabilities. (Expected in June)
6. More modalities of other models. (Expected in June)
7. Fine-tuning model training with additional data. (Expected in June)

Creating custom robot behaviors as advanced interactions with the MyShell platform will earn our airdrop (Token). In addition, the Bot creator will receive Shell Tokens from user subscriptions as an economic return.
