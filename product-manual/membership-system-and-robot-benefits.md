# Membership System and Robot Benefits

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system. Users need to consume power when interacting with robots. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery speeds, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation of robots in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can invite friends or acquire MyShell Pass NFT to upgrade their membership level and gain more robot benefits. There are two paths to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
