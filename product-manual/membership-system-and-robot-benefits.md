# Membership System and Robot Benefits

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is bound to the power system. Users need to consume power when interacting with robots. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery speeds, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation of Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can upgrade their membership level by inviting friends or obtaining MyShell Pass NFT to gain more robot benefits. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
