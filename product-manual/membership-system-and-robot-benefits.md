# Membership System and Robot Benefits

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, and user interaction with robots consumes power. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation of robot workshops.

Any MyShell user can increase their membership level by inviting friends or acquiring MyShell Pass NFT, and enjoy more robot benefits. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
