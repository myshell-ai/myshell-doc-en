# Membership System and Robot Benefits

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is bound to the power system, and user interaction with robots requires power consumption. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery speeds, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation of robots in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can increase their membership level by inviting friends, obtaining MyShell Pass NFT, and gaining more robot benefits. There are two routes to upgrade the membership level, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
