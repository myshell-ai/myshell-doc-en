# Membership System and Robot Benefits

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, where users need to consume power when interacting with robots. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation of robots in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can increase their membership level by inviting friends or obtaining a MyShell Pass NFT to gain more robot benefits. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
