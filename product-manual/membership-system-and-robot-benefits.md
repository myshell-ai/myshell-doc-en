# Membership System and Robot Benefits

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, where users need to consume power when interacting with robots. Higher level members have higher power limits and recovery speeds, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation process in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can upgrade their membership level by inviting friends or acquiring a MyShell Pass NFT, gaining more robot benefits. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with a MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
