# Membership System and Robot Rights (Beta)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, and user interaction with robots requires power consumption. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in creation in the Robot Workshop.

MyShell's memberships are divided into 3 categories: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass. Higher-level members can enjoy more robot rights.
