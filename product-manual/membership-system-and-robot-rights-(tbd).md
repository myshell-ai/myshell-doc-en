# Membership System and Robot Rights (TBD)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, and users need to consume power when interacting with robots. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation process in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can invite friends and participate in community activities to upgrade their membership level and gain more robot rights. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.

### Basic (TBD)
