# Membership System and Robot Rights (TBD)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is bound to the power system, and user interaction with robots requires power consumption. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in robot workshop creations.

Any MyShell user can improve their membership level by inviting friends or participating in community activities to gain more robot rights. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, with MyShell Genesis Pass users starting at Lv.3.

### Basic (TBD)
