# Membership System and Robot Rights (TBD)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system. Users need to consume power when interacting with robots. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in creating robots in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can upgrade their membership level and gain more robot rights by inviting friends and participating in community activities. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
