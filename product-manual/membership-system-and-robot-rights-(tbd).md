# Membership System and Robot Rights (TBD)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, where users need to consume power when interacting with robots. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation process in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can upgrade their membership level by inviting friends or participating in community activities to gain more robot rights. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, with MyShell Genesis Pass users starting at Lv.3.

### Basic (TBD)
