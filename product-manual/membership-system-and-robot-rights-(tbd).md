# Membership System and Robot Rights (TBD)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, and user interactions with robots consume power. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery speeds, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation of robots in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can improve their membership level and gain more robot rights by inviting friends and participating in community activities. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users who own MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
