* Isolated private BOTs and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs.

(The override function currently has a BUG, which is being urgently fixed)

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is a further upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in our workshop, surpassing the capabilities of other knowledge bases on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-round dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about the MyShell project by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component will be rolled out in MyShell's robot creation workshop for use in your own BOT!
