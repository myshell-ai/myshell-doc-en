* BOT's standalone page can now be shared, whether it's a chat record or BOT, the shared content will include the inviter's link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tags;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text replies allow BOTs to reply while outputting, making the speed improvement for long replies explosive!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output styling errors, please adjust with us later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese and English, can be set in the Settings in the personal center. It doesn't currently affect translation results, but will be available later.

* Isolated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs are overwritten by the public function, similar to the test environment and official environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The overwrite function currently has a BUG and is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed the issue of recording failure and sending long voice messages failure.
* Fixed the issue of voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

* Updated product interaction framework: adopted the most familiar IM features - chat, list, personal center, a robot's IM, super cool!
* Updated membership system: divided into regular and genesis, each with 5 levels. The Genesis Pass will focus on robot creation rights, and a limited-time free trial will be available soon, with all users above level 2 enjoying all level 5 features!

@Ethan | Support is now available, which is an upgrade to our workshop's knowledge base capabilities, surpassing other knowledge bases on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It's a single-round conversation robot, and you can answer MyShell project questions by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
