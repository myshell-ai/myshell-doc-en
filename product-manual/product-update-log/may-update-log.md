* Separated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs are covered by the public function, equivalent to the test environment and the official environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The covering function currently has a BUG, which is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed the issue of recording failure and sending long voice messages failure.
* Fixed the issue of voice length/cross-device synchronized voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade of the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass other knowledge bases on the market that we know of. This BOT can obtain detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. This is a single-round conversation robot, you can answer MyShell project questions by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base components will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
