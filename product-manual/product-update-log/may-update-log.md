@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade of the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass those of other knowledge bases we know of in the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-round dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about the MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
