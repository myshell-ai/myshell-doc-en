(The override function currently has a BUG, and is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade of the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass other knowledge bases we know in the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It's a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions in the MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base components will be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOTs!
