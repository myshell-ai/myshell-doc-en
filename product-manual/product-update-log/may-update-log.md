@Ethan | Support is now available, this is a further upgrade of our knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass those of other known knowledge bases on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions in the MyShell project by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
