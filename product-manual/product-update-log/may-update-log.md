### 20230521

* BOT's individual pages can be shared now, whether it's chat history or BOT, the sharing will include the inviter's link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tags;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text responses allow BOTs to reply while outputting, resulting in explosive speed improvement for long responses!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please help us adjust it later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, set in the Settings in the personal center. It currently does not affect translation results, but will be introduced later;

### 20230517

* Separated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overridden by the public function, similar to the test environment and the formal environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The override function currently has a BUG, which is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed the issue of recording failure and sending long voice messages failure.
* Fixed the issue of voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

### 20230507

* Membership system update: divided into ordinary and genesis, with 5 levels each, the Genesis Pass will focus on robot creation rights, and a limited-time free trial will be available soon, with all users above level 2 enjoying all level 5 features!

@Ethan | Support is now available, which is a further upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop. Its capabilities surpass those of other known knowledge bases on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-round dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about the MyShell project by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component will be launched in the MyShell robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
