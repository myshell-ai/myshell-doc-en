* Separated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overridden by making them public, similar to a testing and production environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The override function currently has a BUG and is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass other knowledge base capabilities we know of in the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answers. This is a single-round conversation robot, and you can answer questions about MyShell projects by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
