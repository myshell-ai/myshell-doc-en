* Isolated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs.

(The override feature currently has a BUG, which is being urgently fixed)

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade to the workshop's knowledge base capabilities, which surpasses the capabilities of other knowledge bases on the market that we know of. This BOT can obtain detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-round dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about the MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
