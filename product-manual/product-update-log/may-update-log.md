* BOT's standalone pages can now be shared, whether it's a chat history or BOT, the sharing will include the "sharer's" invitation link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tag;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice capabilities - the streaming TTS and text replies allow the BOT to respond while outputting, resulting in explosive speed improvements for long replies!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output styling errors, please adjust with us later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, can be set in the Settings of the personal center. It currently does not affect translation results, but will be added later;

### 20230517

* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, which is a further upgrade of our knowledge base capabilities in the workshop. Its capabilities surpass those of other knowledge bases we know of on the market. This BOT can obtain detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about the MyShell project by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
