* Please note: After updating the BOT, if it can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the TG BOT will prioritize calling public BOTs.
* Private BOTs can also create Telegram bots!
* You can set the introduction of the BOT yourself, and you can even create a fan group for your BOT!

### 20230521

* Individual BOT pages can now be shared, whether it's a chat record or a BOT, the sharing will include the "sharer's" invitation link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tag;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text responses allow the BOT to reply while outputting, reaching an explosive level of speed improvement for long responses!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please adjust with us later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, set in the Settings in the personal center. It currently does not affect the translation results, but it will be introduced later;

### 20230517

* Separated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and will no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overridden by making them public, equivalent to a test environment and a formal environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The override function currently has a BUG and is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

* Product interaction framework update: adopts the most familiar IM features - chat, list, personal center, a robot's IM, super cool!
* Membership system update: divided into regular and genesis, with 5 levels each, the Genesis Pass will focus on robot creation rights, and a limited-time free trial will be available soon, with all users above level 2 enjoying all the features of level 5!&#x20;

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass other knowledge base capabilities we know on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about the MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop, for your own BOT!
