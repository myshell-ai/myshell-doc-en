@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade of the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass other knowledge bases on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, you can answer questions about the MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same capabilities of the knowledge base component will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
