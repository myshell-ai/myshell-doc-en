* Please note: After updating, if the BOT can be public, don't forget to update it, as the TG BOT will prioritize calling public BOTs.

* BOT's standalone page can be shared, and whether it's chat history or BOT, the shared content will include the "sharer's" invitation link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tags;
* Significantly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text replies allow BOTs to respond while outputting, achieving explosive speed improvements for long replies!
* Support for Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please help us adjust it later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, can be set in the Settings in the personal center. It currently does not affect translation results, but will be introduced later;

### 20230517

* Separated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overwritten by the public function, similar to the test environment and the official environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The overwrite function currently has a BUG and is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

### 20230507

* The Robot Workshop is officially online: supports name, avatar, introduction, system prompt words, and TTS selection; in the coming week, we will gradually support the customization of chat features, knowledge base access, and other powerful features!&#x20;
* Product interaction framework update: adopted the most familiar IM features - chat, list, personal center, a robot's IM, super cool!
* Membership system update: divided into regular and genesis, with 5 levels each. The Genesis Pass will focus on robot creation rights, and a limited-time free trial will be available soon, with all level 2 and above users enjoying all level 5 features!&#x20;
* Supports Telegram binding: this is a new cross-platform, cross-APP attempt, and the future web version can bind various APPs on different platforms and enjoy the same membership benefits.

@Ethan | Support is now available, which is a further upgrade of our knowledge base capabilities in the workshop. Its capabilities surpass other knowledge bases on the market we know of. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions in the MyShell project by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base components will also be launched in the MyShell robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
