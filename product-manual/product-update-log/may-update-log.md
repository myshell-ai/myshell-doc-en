# May Update Log

### 20230521

* BOT's individual pages can now be shared, whether it's a chat history or BOT, the sharing will include the inviter's link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tags;
* Significantly improved the response speed of voice BOTs - the streaming TTS and text replies allow the BOT to respond while outputting, resulting in an explosive speed increase for long responses!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please help us adjust it together later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, can be set in the Settings in the personal center. Currently, it doesn't affect the translation results, but it will be introduced later;

### 20230517

* Isolated private and public bots, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overridden by public features, similar to test and production environments. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (There is currently a BUG in the override function, which is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed the issue of recording failure and sending long voice messages failure.
* Fixed the issue of voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade of the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass other knowledge bases we know on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It's a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions in the MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same capability knowledge base components will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
