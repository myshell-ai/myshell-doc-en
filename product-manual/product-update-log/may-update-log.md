@Ethan | Support is now available, this is a further upgrade of our workshop's knowledge base capabilities, surpassing other knowledge bases we know of in the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about the MyShell project by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
