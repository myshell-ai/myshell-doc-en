* Set up in 5 minutes, and you can have your own Telegram bot!

* Please note: After the update, if your BOT can be public, don't forget to update it, as the TG BOT will prioritize calling public BOTs
* Private BOTs can also create Telegram bots!
* You can set your BOT's introduction and even attract fans for your BOT!

### 20230521

* BOT's standalone page can be shared now, whether it's a chat record or a BOT, the sharing will include the "sharer's" invitation link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name, tag;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text replies allow BOTs to respond while outputting, resulting in explosive speed improvements for long responses!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please adjust with us later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, set in the Settings in your personal center. Currently, it does not affect translation results, but will be introduced later;

### 20230517

* Separated private and public BOTs. Private BOTs can be used for debugging without directly affecting public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overwritten by enabling the public feature, similar to test and production environments. Public BOTs can no longer be edited (there is currently a BUG in the overwrite feature, which is being urgently fixed).
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device syncing of voice messages not loading.

### 20230507

* Optimized chat, voice auto-play, conversation sharing, and other experiences
* Optimized mobile adaptation, reducing crashes, white screens, and other issues

* Robot Workshop officially launched: supports name, avatar, introduction, system prompts, and TTS selection; in the coming week, we will gradually support powerful features such as custom chat functions and knowledge base access!
* Product interaction framework updated: adopted the most familiar IM features - chat, list, personal center, a robot's IM, super cool!
* Membership system updated: divided into regular and genesis, with 5 levels each, the Genesis Pass will focus on robot creation rights, and a limited-time free trial will be available soon, with all level 2 and above users enjoying all level 5 features!
* Supports Telegram binding: this is a new attempt at cross-platform, cross-APP integration, with the future web version able to bind to various APPs and enjoy the same membership benefits across different platforms.

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass other knowledge bases we know of in the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-round dialogue robot, and you can answer questions in MyShell projects by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
