* BOT's standalone page can be shared now, whether it's a chat history or BOT, the sharing will include the "sharer's" invitation link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tags;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text replies allow BOTs to reply while outputting, resulting in explosive speed improvements for long replies!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please adjust with us later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, can be set in the Settings in the personal center. It currently does not affect translation results, but will be introduced later;

* Separated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overridden with public functions, similar to test and production environments. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The override function currently has a BUG, which is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed the issues of recording failure and sending long voice messages failure.
* Fixed the issue of voice length/cross-device synchronized voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is available now, this is our further upgrade of the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass other knowledge bases we know in the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It's a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions in MyShell projects by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component will be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
