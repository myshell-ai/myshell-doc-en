# May Update Log

### 20230521

* BOT individual pages can now be shared, whether it's a chat history or BOT, the sharing will include the "sharer's" invitation link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tags;
* Greatly improved the response speed of voice-enabled BOTs - streaming TTS and text responses allow BOTs to reply while outputting, resulting in explosive speed improvements for long responses!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please adjust with us afterwards!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, can be set in the Settings in the personal center. Currently, it does not affect translation results, but will be introduced later;

### 20230517

* Separated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and will no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overwritten by enabling the public feature, similar to a testing and production environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The overwrite feature currently has a BUG, and is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed the issue of recording failure and sending long voice messages failure.
* Fixed the issue of voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

### 20230507

* Optimized chat, voice auto-play, conversation sharing, and other experiences
* Optimized mobile adaptation, reducing crashes, white screens, and other issues

* Robot Workshop officially launched: supports name, avatar, introduction, system prompt words, and TTS selection; in the coming week, we will gradually support powerful features such as custom chat functions and knowledge base access!
* Product interaction framework update: adopted the most familiar IM features - chat, list, personal center, an IM for robots, super cool!
* Membership system update: divided into regular and genesis, each with 5 levels, the Genesis Pass will focus on robot creation rights, and will soon offer a limited-time free trial, all users above level 2 can enjoy all the features of level 5!&#x20;
* Supports Telegram binding: this is a new attempt at cross-platform and cross-APP integration, the future web version can bind various APPs across platforms and enjoy the same membership benefits on different platforms.

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is a further upgrade of our knowledge base capabilities in the Workshop, surpassing other knowledge base capabilities we know of in the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. This is a single-turn dialogue robot, you can answer questions in the MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
