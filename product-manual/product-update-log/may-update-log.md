* BOT's individual pages can now be shared, and the invitation link of the "sharer" will be attached when sharing, whether it's chat history or BOT;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tag;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - stream-based TTS and text replies allow BOTs to reply while outputting, resulting in an explosive speed increase for long replies!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please adjust with us later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, which can be set in the Settings in the personal center. It currently does not affect translation results, but will be available later;

### 20230517

* Separated private and public BOTs - private BOTs can be used for debugging and will no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overridden by the public function, equivalent to a test environment and a formal environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The override function currently has a BUG, which is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, which is a further upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in our workshop. Its capabilities surpass those of other knowledge bases we know in the market. This BOT can obtain detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about MyShell projects by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
