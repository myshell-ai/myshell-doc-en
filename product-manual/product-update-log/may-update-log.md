* BOT's individual pages can now be shared, whether it's chat history or BOT, the sharing will include the inviter's link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tags;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text replies allow BOTs to respond while outputting, resulting in explosive speed improvements for long replies!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please adjust with us later!)

* Separated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs.

* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, which is a further upgrade of our knowledge base capabilities in the workshop. Its capabilities surpass those of other knowledge bases we know in the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about MyShell projects by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
