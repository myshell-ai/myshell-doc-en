@Ethan | Support is now available, which is a further upgrade to our workshop's knowledge base capabilities, surpassing other knowledge base capabilities we know on the market. This BOT can obtain detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions in the MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component capabilities will also be launched in the MyShell robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
