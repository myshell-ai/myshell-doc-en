# May Update Log

### 20230521

* BOT's individual pages can now be shared, whether it's chat history or BOT, the sharing will include the "sharer's" invitation link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tags;
* Greatly improved the response speed of voice-enabled BOTs - streaming TTS and text responses allow BOTs to reply while outputting, resulting in explosive speed improvements for long responses!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please adjust with us later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, set in the Settings in the personal center. Currently, it does not affect the translation results, but will be introduced later;

### 20230517

* Separated private and public bots, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overwritten by public functions, similar to testing and production environments. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The overwrite function currently has a BUG, which is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages failure.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is an upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in our workshop, its capabilities surpass other known knowledge base capabilities on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. This is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions in the MyShell project by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
