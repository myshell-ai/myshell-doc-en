@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass other knowledge bases we know of in the market. This BOT can obtain detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. This is a single-round dialogue robot, you can answer questions in MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
