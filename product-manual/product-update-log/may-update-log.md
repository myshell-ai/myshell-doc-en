### 20230531

* Set up your own Telegram bot in just 5 minutes!
* Check out the tutorial: [https://docs.myshell.ai/v/zhong-wen/product-manual/ling-qu-zi-ji-de-telegram-ji-qi-ren](https://docs.myshell.ai/v/zhong-wen/product-manual/ling-qu-zi-ji-de-telegram-ji-qi-ren)
* Please note: After updating your BOT, if it can be made public, don't forget to update it, as TG BOT will prioritize calling public BOTs.
* Private BOTs can also create Telegram bots!
* You can set your BOT's introduction and even attract fans for your BOT!

### 20230521

* BOT's standalone page can be shared now, whether it's a chat history or a BOT, the sharing will include the inviter's link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tag;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text replies allow the BOT to reply while outputting, resulting in explosive speed improvement for long replies!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please adjust with us later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, set in the Settings of your personal center. It currently does not affect translation results, but will be introduced later;

### 20230517

* Separated private BOTs and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overridden by enabling public functionality, essentially creating a test environment and a production environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The override function currently has a BUG and is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

### 20230507

* Optimized chat, automatic voice playback, conversation sharing, and other experiences
* Optimized mobile adaptation, reducing crashes, white screens, and other issues

### 20230504 v3.1&#x20;

* Robot Workshop officially launched: supports name, avatar, introduction, system prompt words, and TTS selection; in the coming week, we will gradually support powerful features such as custom chat functions and knowledge base access!
* Product interaction framework updated: adopted the most familiar IM features - chat, list, personal center, a robot's IM, super cool!
* Membership system update: divided into regular and Genesis, with 5 levels each. Genesis Pass will focus on robot creation rights, and a limited-time free trial will be available soon. All users above level 2 can enjoy all level 5 features!
* Supports Telegram binding: a new cross-platform, cross-app attempt. The future web version can bind various apps and enjoy the same membership benefits across different platforms.

@Ethan | Support is now available, which is an upgrade to our workshop's knowledge base capabilities, surpassing other knowledge base capabilities on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer questions about the MyShell project by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component will be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
