* BOT's standalone page can be shared now, whether it's a chat history or BOT, the shared content will carry the "sharer's" invitation link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tag;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text replies allow BOTs to respond while outputting, achieving explosive speed improvements for long replies!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output styling errors, please help us adjust it later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, set in the Settings in the personal center. It doesn't currently affect translation results, but will be added later;

* Separated private and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overwritten by enabling the public function, essentially creating a test and production environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The overwrite function currently has a BUG and is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device synchronization of voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, which is a further upgrade of the knowledge base capabilities in our workshop. Its capabilities surpass those of other knowledge bases on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It's a single-turn conversation robot, and you can answer questions about MyShell projects by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component capabilities will be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
