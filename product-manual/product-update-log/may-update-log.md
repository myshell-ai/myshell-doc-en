* Isolated private BOTs and public BOTs, private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs.

(The override function currently has a BUG, which is being urgently fixed)

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, its capabilities surpass those of other knowledge bases we know of in the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. This is a single-turn dialogue robot, which you can use to answer MyShell project questions by @ it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
