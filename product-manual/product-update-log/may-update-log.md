@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade to the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop. Its capabilities surpass those of other knowledge bases on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. This is a single-round dialogue robot, and you can answer MyShell project questions by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
