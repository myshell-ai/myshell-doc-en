* BOT's standalone page can now be shared, whether it's a chat record or BOT, and the sharing will include the "sharer's" invitation link;
* Workshop supports searching and filtering by name and tags;
* Greatly improved the response speed of BOTs with voice - streaming TTS and text replies allow BOTs to respond while outputting, resulting in an explosive speed increase for long responses!
* Supports Markdown (may cause some output style errors, please help us adjust it together later!)
* Interface supports multiple languages: Chinese, English, set in the Settings in the personal center. It currently does not affect translation results, but will be introduced later;

* Separated private and public BOTs. Private BOTs can be used for debugging and no longer directly affect public BOTs. Public BOTs can be overwritten through the public function, similar to a test environment and a formal environment. Public BOTs can no longer be edited. (The overwrite function currently has a BUG and is being urgently fixed)
* Fixed issues with recording failure and sending long voice messages.
* Fixed issues with voice length/cross-device sync voice messages not loading.

@Ethan | Support is now available, this is our further upgrade of the knowledge base capabilities in the workshop, and its capabilities surpass those of other knowledge bases on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer MyShell project-related questions by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component will be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
