@Ethan | Support is now available, which is a further upgrade of our workshop's knowledge base capabilities, surpassing the capabilities of other knowledge bases we know on the market. This BOT can extract detailed information from documents and inform users of the source of the answer. It is a single-turn dialogue robot, and you can answer MyShell project questions by @ing it in DC. In the next few days, the same knowledge base component with the same capabilities will also be launched in MyShell's robot creation workshop for your own BOT!
