**Quick Voice Cloning feature**&#x20;

* With just 1-3 minutes of high-quality input audio, you can make the robot imitate anyone's speech! The current version supports only English and voice cloning, and does not support accents and emotions yet. Stay tuned for the next version!&#x20;
* If you are not satisfied with the cloned voice, please feel free to give us feedback!&#x20;
* Little tip: Longer recording time does not necessarily mean better results, clear and noise-free input audio will produce ideal results~

* The artifact for automatically creating robots: AutoPrompt is now online. It can generate robots based on your language description. Its effect is at least equivalent to the level of ordinary people learning Prompt for more than 20 hours!

* You can now use Shift + Enter to create a new line in the text input box.
* Telegram BOT can now communicate with BOT by replying to BOT's messages in group chat mode.
