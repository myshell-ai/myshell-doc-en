# June Update Log

### 20230627

* Bot Popularity Ranking is now live, calculating the number of messages bots receive within 7 days starting from June 27th and ranking them accordingly. Rankings will directly affect the display order in the Workshop list and will be updated every hour.
* Featured bot list is now open, and we will regularly select bots based on their stability, innovation, and popularity to enter the Featured List. Featured bots will also gain more exposure! Keep improving your bot!
* Creator Dashboard: Creators can now see their bot's highest daily popularity ranking and ranking trends since June 27th. Additionally, we've differentiated between invite codes and Telegram Bot invites for effective invitations and provided historical invite quantity trends for better promotion management (we will also open up more reward channels in the next major version, so stay tuned!)
* Bot creation now supports GPT-4! Friends with Genesis Passcards can choose to use the GPT-4 model to take your bot's abilities to the next level!
* After updating a Prompt, friends who are chatting with the bot will be notified so they can clear the bot's memory and make the new Prompt effective.
* Bot public voice samples now support more languages, including: French, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, Spanish, and German.

### 20230620

* Input limit for chatting with bots has been increased from 1000 tokens to 1500.
* After sharing chat records, clicking on the experience will directly add the bot to the chat list for a faster chatting experience for newcomers.
* Unsent text will be temporarily stored in the chat box for easier switching between different bots.
* Other interface style and experience optimizations, including enlarged chat font on mobile devices.

**Fast Voice Cloning Feature**

* With just 1-3 minutes of high-quality input audio, you can make your bot imitate anyone's speech! The current version only supports English and cloned voice timbre, and does not yet support accents and emotions - stay tuned for the next version!
* If you're not satisfied with the cloned voice, feel free to provide feedback!
* Tip: Longer recording times don't necessarily mean better results; clear input audio without background noise will yield better results.

**Auto Prompt Evolution**

* Provides complete generated Prompt for users to continuously improve upon.

**Other**

* Fixed the issue of missing audio in specific text segments. Disabled audio generation for Markdown-formatted text and emojis.

### 20230608

* AutoPrompt, the automatic bot creation tool, is now live! It can generate bots based on your language description, with results at least equivalent to a person studying Prompt for over 20 hours!
* If you're an advanced player, we will open up the generated Prompt in next week's version for further optimization.
* You can now use Shift + Enter to create a new line in the text input box.
* Telegram BOT now supports replying to BOT messages in group chat mode.
* Knowledge Base has been quietly updated to support URL parsing (currently only supports parsing one layer of URL text). Feel free to test it out, and if you encounter any issues, please provide feedback so we can improve this feature.
