# June Update Log

### 20230627

* Bot popularity leaderboard goes live, calculating the number of messages a bot receives within 7 days starting from June 27th and ranking them accordingly. The ranking will directly affect the display order in the workshop list and will be updated hourly~
* Featured bot list is now open. We will regularly select some bots based on their stability, innovation, and popularity to be featured, giving them even more exposure! Keep improving your bot~
* Creator dashboard: Creators can see the highest daily ranking of their bot and the ranking trend after June 27th at different times. For effective invitations, we distinguish between invitation codes and Telegram Bot-invited friends, and you can also see the historical invitation quantity curve to better grasp the promotion rhythm (we will also open up more reward channels in the next major version, stay tuned~)
* Robot creation now supports GPT-4. Friends with a Genesis Passcard can choose to use the GPT-4 model to take your bot's abilities to the next level!
* After updating a Prompt, it will notify friends who have been chatting with the bot, so you can clear the bot's memory in time to make the latest Prompt effective~
* Bot public voice samples now support more language options, including: French, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, Spanish, and German

### 20230620

* Input limit for chatting with bots has been increased from 1000 tokens to 1500
* After sharing chat history, clicking on the experience will directly add the bot to the chat list to start chatting, allowing new friends to experience chatting more quickly
* Unsent text will be temporarily stored in the chat box for switching between different bots
* Other interface styles and experience optimizations, enlarged mobile chat font

### 20230616

**Fast Voice Cloning Feature**&#x20;

* With just 1-3 minutes of high-quality input audio, you can make the robot imitate anyone's speech! The current version only supports English and cloning voice timbre, and does not yet support accents and emotions. Please look forward to the next version!&#x20;
* If you are not satisfied with the cloned voice, please feel free to give us feedback!&#x20;
* Small tip: Longer recording times do not necessarily result in better effects. Clear input audio without background noise will produce ideal results~

**Auto Prompt Evolution**&#x20;

* Provides complete generated Prompts, allowing everyone to continuously improve based on this foundation

**Other**&#x20;

* Fixed the issue of missing audio for specific text segments Disabled audio generation for Markdown formatted text and emojis

### 20230608

* The magical tool for automatically creating robots, AutoPrompt, is now online! It can generate robots based on your language description. Its effect is at least equivalent to a regular person learning Prompts for more than 20 hours!
* If you are an advanced player, we will open up the generated Prompts in next week's version for everyone to further optimize based on this foundation.
* You can now use Shift + Enter to insert a line break in the text input box.
* In group chat mode, you can now reply to the Telegram BOT's messages to chat with the BOT.
* Knowledge base has been quietly updated to support URL parsing (currently only able to parse one level of URL text). Everyone can try it out, and if you encounter any unsolvable scenarios, please give us feedback and we will gradually improve this feature.
