# June Update Log

### 20230608

* The magical tool for automatically creating robots: AutoPrompt is now online! It can generate robots based on your language description. Its effectiveness is at least equivalent to an ordinary person learning Prompt for more than 20 hours!
* If you are an advanced player, we will open the generated Prompt in next week's version for everyone to further optimize based on this foundation.
* You can now use Shift + Enter to create a new line in the text input box.
* Telegram BOT can now chat with the BOT by replying to its messages in group chat mode.
* The knowledge base has been quietly updated to support URL parsing (currently only able to parse one layer of URL text). Everyone can try it out first, and if you encounter unsolvable scenarios, please give us feedback, and we will gradually improve this feature.
