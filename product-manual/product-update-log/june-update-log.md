* Bot Popularity Ranking is now live, starting from June 27th, the number of messages within 7 days will be calculated and ranked accordingly. The ranking will directly affect the display order in the workshop list and will be updated hourly.
* Featured bot list is now open, we will regularly select some bots based on their stability, innovation, and popularity to enter the featured list. Featured bots will also have greater exposure! Keep improving your bot.
* Creator Dashboard: Creators can see the highest daily popularity ranking of their bot and the ranking trend after June 27th at different times. For effective invitations, we have distinguished between invitation codes and Telegram Bot invitations, and everyone can see the historical invitation curve, which helps to better grasp the promotion rhythm (we will also open up rich reward channels in the next major version, so stay tuned~)
* Robot creation now supports GPT-4, friends with Genesis Passcard can choose to use the GPT-4 model to take your bot's abilities to the next level!
* After updating the Prompt, friends who are chatting with the bot will be notified, so you can promptly clear the bot's memory to make the latest Prompt effective.

**Quick Voice Cloning Feature**&#x20;

* With just 1-3 minutes of high-quality input audio, you can make your robot imitate anyone's speech! The current version only supports English and cloning voice tone, and does not support accents and emotions yet, please look forward to the next version!
* If you are not satisfied with the cloned voice, please feel free to give us feedback!
