* Bot Popularity Rankings are now live, starting from June 27th, the number of messages within 7 days for bots will be calculated and ranked accordingly. The ranking will directly affect the display order in the workshop list, updated every hour~ 
* Featured bot list is now open, we will regularly select some bots based on stability, innovation, and popularity to enter the featured list. Featured bots will also have greater exposure! Keep improving your bot~ 
* Creator Dashboard: Creators can see the highest daily popularity ranking of their bot and the ranking trend after June 27th at different times; for effective invitations, we have differentiated between invitation codes and Telegram Bot invitations, and everyone can see the historical invitation quantity curve, allowing you to better grasp the promotion rhythm (we will also open up rich reward channels in the next major version, stay tuned~) 
* Bot creation now supports GPT-4, friends with a Genesis Passcard can choose to use the GPT-4 model to take your bot's abilities to the next level! 
* After updating the Prompt, friends who are conversing with the bot will be notified, so you can promptly clear the bot's memory to make the latest Prompt effective~

**Fast Voice Cloning Feature**&#x20;

* With just 1-3 minutes of high-quality input audio, you can make a robot imitate anyone's speech! The current version only supports English and voice cloning, and does not yet support accents and emotions. Please look forward to the next version!&#x20;
* If you are not satisfied with the cloned voice, please feel free to provide feedback!&#x20;
