# June Update Log

### 20230608

* The magic tool for automatically creating robots: AutoPrompt is now online! It can generate robots based on your language description. Its effect is at least equivalent to an ordinary person learning Prompt for more than 20 hours!
* If you are an advanced player, we will open the generated Prompt in next week's version for everyone to use as a basis for further optimization.
* You can now use Shift + Enter to create a new line in the text input box.
* Telegram BOT in group chat mode can now have a conversation with the BOT by replying to its message.
* The knowledge base has been quietly updated to support URL parsing (currently only able to parse one level of URL text). Everyone can try it out, and if you encounter any unsolvable scenarios, please give us feedback and we will gradually improve this feature.
