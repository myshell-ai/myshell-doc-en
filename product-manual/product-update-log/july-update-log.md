Major Update: Rewards Center and Brand New Membership System

* MyShell points system is now live! We will implement a points season system so that everyone can earn while playing on the platform! The first season will start from 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) until 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4). During the first 12 days of the season, you can earn massive points by completing tasks. Although points redemption is not yet available, all task completion progress will be automatically recorded, and you can accumulate and redeem points when we open points redemption!
* With 3 days left in the season, we will open the points exchange store, and at the same time, season points will no longer be obtainable. Points generated by newly completed tasks will accumulate to the next season for cumulative redemption. In the exchange store, you can use points to redeem various rewards, including energy cards, our brand new membership cards, and even the Genesis Pass!
* Brand new membership system: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass, three types of memberships will have corresponding different benefits (trial operation stage, may change in the future). In Season 1, we will offer a limited-time free trial of the Standard Battle Pass for the entire site. We hope everyone can use the S1 free trial benefits to earn more points and redeem more lasting benefits in the future!

Other optimizations:

* Italics in bot replies will no longer be read out by voice
* The character limit for bot descriptions has been increased
