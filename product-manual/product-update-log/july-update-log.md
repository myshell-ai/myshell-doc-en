Major update: Reward Center and new membership system

* MyShell points system is now live, and we will have everyone earn while playing on the platform according to the points season system! The first season will run from 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) to 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4). During the first 12 days of the season, you can earn massive points by completing tasks. Although points collection is not yet open, all task completion progress will be automatically recorded, and you can accumulate and claim points when we open points collection!
* With 3 days left in the season, we will open the points exchange store, and at the same time, season points will no longer be available, and new task-generated points will be accumulated to the next season for cumulative collection; in the exchange store, you can use points to redeem various rewards, including energy cards, our brand new membership cards, and even the Genesis Pass!
* New membership system: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass, the three memberships will have different corresponding benefits (trial run stage, may change in the future); In the S1 season, we will offer a limited-time free experience of the Standard Battle Pass for the entire site, hoping that everyone can use the S1 free benefits to earn more points and exchange for subsequent lasting benefits!

Other optimizations:
