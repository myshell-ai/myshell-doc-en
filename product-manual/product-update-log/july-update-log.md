Major update: Reward Center and a brand new membership system

* MyShell points system is now live, and we will implement a points season system so that everyone can earn while playing on the platform! The first season will run from 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) to 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4). Everyone can earn massive points by completing tasks within the first 12 days of the season. Although point redemption is not yet available, all task completion progress will be automatically recorded, and you can accumulate points for redemption when it becomes available!
* With 3 days left in the season, we will open the points redemption store, and season points will no longer be obtainable. Points generated by newly completed tasks will be accumulated for the next season; in the redemption store, you can use points to redeem various rewards, including energy cards, our brand new membership cards, and even Genesis Passes!
* A brand new membership system: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass, each offering different benefits (subject to change during the trial run); during S1 season, we will offer a limited-time free trial of the Standard Battle Pass for everyone, hoping that you can use the S1 free trial benefits to earn more points and redeem lasting benefits for the future!

Other optimizations:

* Italics in bot replies will no longer be read out by the voice
* The character limit for bot descriptions has been increased
