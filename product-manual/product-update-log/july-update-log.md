Major Update: Reward Center and Brand New Membership System

* MyShell points system is now live! We will implement a points season system so that everyone can earn while playing on the platform! The first season will start from 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) and end at 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4). During the first 12 days of the season, everyone can earn massive points by completing tasks. Although point redemption is not yet open, all task completion progress will be automatically recorded, and you can accumulate and redeem points when we open point redemption!
* With 3 days left in the season, we will open the points exchange store, and at the same time, season points will no longer be obtainable. Points generated by new tasks will be accumulated for the next season; in the exchange store, you can use points to redeem a variety of rewards, including power cards, our brand new membership cards, and even the Genesis Pass!
* Brand new membership system: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass, each type of membership will have different corresponding benefits (subject to change during the trial run phase). In Season 1, we will offer a limited free trial of the Standard Battle Pass for all users. We hope that everyone can use the S1 free trial benefits to earn more points and redeem for more lasting benefits in the future!

Other optimizations:

* Italic text in bot replies will no longer be read out loud by the voice
* The character limit for input in bot descriptions has been increased
