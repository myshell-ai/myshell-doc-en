Major update: Reward Center and a brand new membership system

* MyShell points system is now live, and we will adopt a points season system to allow everyone to earn while playing on the platform! The first season will start from 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) and end at 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4). In the first 12 days of the season, you can earn massive points by completing tasks. Although point redemption is not yet available, all task completion progress will be automatically recorded, and you can accumulate points for redemption when we open it!
* With 3 days left in the season, we will open the points exchange store, and season points will no longer be available. Points earned from newly completed tasks will be accumulated for the next season; in the exchange store, you can use points to redeem various rewards, including energy cards, our brand new membership cards, and even the Genesis Pass!
* A brand new membership system: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass, with three types of memberships offering different benefits (subject to change during the trial run); for S1 season, we will offer a limited-time free experience of the Standard Battle Pass site-wide, and we hope everyone can use the S1 free benefits to earn more points and redeem lasting benefits for the future!

Other optimizations:

* Italics in bot replies will no longer be read out by voice
* The character limit for bot descriptions has been increased
