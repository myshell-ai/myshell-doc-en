Major Update: Rewards Center and a brand new membership system

* MyShell points system is now live, allowing everyone to earn points while playing on the platform! The first season will run from 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) to 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4). During the first 12 days of the season, you can earn a lot of points by completing tasks. Although points claim is not yet open, all task completion progress will be automatically recorded, and you can claim the accumulated points when we open points claim!
* With 3 days left in the season, we will open the points exchange store, and season points will no longer be obtainable. Points from newly completed tasks will accumulate to the next season for cumulative claim. In the exchange store, you can use points to redeem various rewards, including energy cards, our brand new membership cards, and even the Genesis Pass!
* A brand new membership system: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass, each with different corresponding benefits (subject to change during the trial run). During the S1 season, we will offer a limited free trial of the Standard Battle Pass for everyone, so you can use the S1 free trial benefits to earn more points and redeem lasting benefits for the future!

Other optimizations:

* Italics in bot replies will no longer be read out by the voice
* The character limit for bot descriptions has been increased
