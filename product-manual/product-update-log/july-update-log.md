Major Update: Reward Center and a Brand New Membership System

* MyShell points system is now live! We will be implementing a points season system, allowing everyone to earn while playing on the platform! The first season will run from 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) to 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4). During the first 12 days of the season, you can earn massive points by completing tasks. Although points redemption is not yet available, all task completion progress will be automatically recorded, and you can accumulate and redeem points when we open the redemption feature!
* With 3 days left in the season, we will open the points exchange store. At the same time, season points will no longer be obtainable, and newly completed task points will be accumulated for the next season. In the exchange store, you can use points to redeem various rewards, including energy cards, our brand new membership cards, and even Genesis Passes!
* The brand new membership system: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass, with three types of memberships having different corresponding benefits (subject to change during the trial run). For the S1 season, we will offer a limited-time free experience of the Standard Battle Pass for all users. We hope that everyone can take advantage of the S1 free benefits to earn more points and redeem more valuable and lasting rewards!

Other optimizations:

* Italic text in bot replies will no longer be read out loud by the voice feature
* The character limit for bot descriptions has been increased
