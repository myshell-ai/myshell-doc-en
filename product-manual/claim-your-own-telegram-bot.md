# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Your bot is mature enough to operate on its own" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to make it happen.

Getting your bot active on Telegram only requires three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token, then your bot can operate on Telegram by itself!

Your tg bot can have private chats with users and group chats, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once you create your tg bot, it will synchronize with your bot on MyShell, and any prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on your tg bot without any extra operations.

What are you waiting for? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, and keep it consistent with the bot on MyShell.
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. Everyone will frequently use this name when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So choose wisely!
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, so please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to let your bot join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

4. Click "Turn off" to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can roam around the world!

If you see this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy setting is set after the bot joins a group chat, it will not take effect for the already joined group chats. In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Return to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click on the "System" tab in the editing interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom in the Token field.

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram.
* If you change the bot's name on MyShell, it will also be synchronized on TG. However, if you change it multiple times within 5 hours, only the first change will be synchronized.
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the TG bot will prioritize calling public bots.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it with others more easily.

Lastly, you can also modify the bot's greeting and explain its usage on Telegram. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit Intro" in the bot details page on Telegram\
