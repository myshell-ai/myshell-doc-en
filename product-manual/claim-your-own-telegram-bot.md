# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to run your own business" sounds like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to make it happen.

Bringing your bot to life on Telegram only takes three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can run its own business on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once the tg bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell. Your prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot, without any additional operations required~

Are you still not tempted? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when people interact with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So think carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is very important, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After the bot is created, press a few buttons to allow your bot to join group chats and start running!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

If you see this screen, it means you've succeeded. However, please note that if privacy settings are set after the bot has joined a group chat, they will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you'll need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. All you need to do is go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click to enter the "System" editing interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom into the Token field to complete the process~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram
* If the bot name is changed on MyShell, it will also sync to TG. However, if it is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first changed name will be synced~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it. TG bot will prioritize fetching public bots

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others.

Last but not least, you can also modify the bot's greeting and usage instructions in Telegram to help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit Intro" in the bot details page on Telegram\
