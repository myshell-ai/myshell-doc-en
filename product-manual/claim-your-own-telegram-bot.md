# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to run your own business" sounds like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it.

It only takes three simple steps to get your bot active on Telegram: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can start running its own business on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once your tg bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and your prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any additional operations~

Are you not tempted yet? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot an easy-to-read username. Everyone will use this name frequently when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be modified. So choose carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is very important, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click to enter the "System" editing interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~
