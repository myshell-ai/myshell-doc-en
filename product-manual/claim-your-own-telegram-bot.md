# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to run your own business" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to make it happen.

To get your bot active on Telegram, you only need three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can run its own business on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats with users and group chats, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once your tg bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and any prompt changes will be reflected in real-time on your tg bot without any extra operation from you~

Are you not tempted yet? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used by people to interact with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So consider it carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After the bot is created, press a few buttons to allow your bot to join group chats and start running its business!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click on "Bot Settings"

4. Click on "Turn off" to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can run around the world!

If you get to this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot has joined a group chat, it will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click to enter the "System" editing interface, and paste the token you copied earlier at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram
* If you change the bot's name on MyShell, it will also sync in TG. However, if you change it multiple times within 5 hours, only the first changed name will sync~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others.

Last but not least, you can also modify the bot's greeting and usage instructions in Telegram to help others get started more quickly. Here's how:

1. Click to modify the bot's details page in Telegram, then click "Edit Intro"\
