# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to operate on your own" sounds like a dream? Now, you can achieve it in just 5 minutes.

It only takes three simple steps to make your bot active on Telegram: create a bot, set permissions, and fill in the token. Then your bot can operate on its own in Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once your tg bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and any changes to your prompt will be reflected in real-time on your tg bot without any additional operations~

Are you tempted yet? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, just keep it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. People will frequently use this name when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So choose carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, so submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to allow your bot to join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

4. Click "Turn off" to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can run around the world!

If you see this interface in the end, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot has joined a group chat, it will not take effect in the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Return to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click to enter the editing interface's "System", and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram
* If you change the bot's name on MyShell, it will also sync in TG. However, if you change it multiple times within 5 hours, only the first changed name will sync~
* If the updated bot can be public, don't forget to update it, as the TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot

Now you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others.

Lastly, you can also modify the bot's greeting and usage instructions in Telegram. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click to edit in the bot details page in Telegram, then "Edit Intro"\
