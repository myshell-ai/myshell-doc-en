# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn how to operate on your own" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it.

To bring your bot to life on Telegram, you only need three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can operate on its own on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once you create the tg bot, it will sync with your bot on MyShell. Any prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot, without any additional operations from you~

Are you excited yet? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot an easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when people interact with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed, so choose carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is very important, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to allow your bot to join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click on "Bot Settings"

4. Click on "Turn off" to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can run around the world!

If you see this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot has joined a group chat, they will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you will need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Return to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click on the "System" tab in the edit interface, and paste the token you just copied into the Token field at the bottom~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram.
* If the bot name is changed on MyShell, it will also be synchronized on TG. However, if you change the name multiple times within 5 hours, only the first change will be synchronized~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it. The TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others.

Last but not least, you can also modify the bot's greeting message on Telegram and explain its usage. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click on "Edit Intro" in the bot details page on Telegram\
