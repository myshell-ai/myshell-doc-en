# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn how to run your own business." Sounds like a dream? Now, you can achieve it in just 5 minutes.

To make your bot active on Telegram, you only need three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can run its own business on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once your tg bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and any prompt changes will be reflected on the tg bot in real-time without any extra operations from you~

Are you tempted? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot's name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. People will use this name frequently when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So choose carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, so please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to enable your bot to join group chats and start running its business!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

4. Click "Turn off" to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can run around the world!

If you see this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot has joined the group chat, it will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click to enter the edit interface of "System", and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram
* If the bot's name is changed on MyShell, it will also sync to TG. However, if the name is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first name change will be synced~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it with others more easily.

Lastly, you can also modify the bot's greeting and usage instructions on Telegram, as interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started more quickly. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit Intro" through the bot details page on Telegram\
