# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Your bot is mature enough to start operating on its own" sounds like a dream? Now, you can make it happen in just 5 minutes.

To make your bot active on Telegram, you only need three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can start operating on Telegram on its own!

Your tg bot can have one-to-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once the tg bot is created, it will synchronize with your bot on MyShell, and your prompt changes will be reflected on the tg bot in real-time without any extra operation from you~

Still not excited? Come and give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the `/newbot` command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell.
4. Give your bot an easy-to-read username, which will be frequently used when people interact with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So choose carefully~
5. The most important step: Copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is very important, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to let your bot join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the `/mybots` command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click on "Bot Settings"

4. Click on "Turn off" to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can run all over the world!

If you get to this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if privacy settings are set after the bot has joined a group chat, it will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click on the "System" in the edit interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task.

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can freely set it up on Telegram.
* If the bot's name is changed on MyShell, it will also be synchronized in TG. However, if the name is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first change will be synchronized.
* After updating the bot, don't forget to update it if it can be made public, as the TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it with others more easily.

Last but not least, you can also modify the bot's greeting and usage instructions on Telegram, making it more interesting and easier for others to get started. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click on "Edit Intro" in the bot details page on Telegram.\
