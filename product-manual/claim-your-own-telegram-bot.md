# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to run your own business" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it.

Getting your bot active on Telegram only requires three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can run its own business on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once the tg bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell. Your prompt changes will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any extra operation~

Are you tempted yet? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, just keep it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give the bot a simple and easy-to-read username. People will frequently use this name when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So choose carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is essential, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to enable your bot to join group chats and start running its business!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

If you get to this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot joins the group chat, it will not take effect on the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step, just go back to MyShell's "Bot Workshop", click to enter the editing interface's "System", and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram
* If the bot's name is changed on MyShell, it will also be synced in TG. However, if it is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first changed name can be synced~
* If the updated bot can be public, don't forget to update it. TG bot will prioritize calling public bots

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it with others more easily.

Last but not least, you can also modify the bot's greeting and usage instructions in Telegram. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click to modify in the bot details page on Telegram, then "Edit Intro"\
