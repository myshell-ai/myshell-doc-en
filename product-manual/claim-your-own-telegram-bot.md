# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

## Bind in 5 minutes, make your bot active on Telegram

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to run your own business" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it. Making your bot active on Telegram only requires three simple steps: create a bot - set permissions - enter the token, and then your bot can run its own business on Telegram! Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once you create a tg bot, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and any prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any extra operation from you~ Are you not tempted yet? Come and give it a try!

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, just keep it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when people interact with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So consider it carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is very important, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.
