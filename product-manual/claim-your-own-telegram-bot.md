# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to operate independently" seems like a dream? Now, you can achieve it in just 5 minutes.

To make your bot active on Telegram, you only need three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can operate on its own in Telegram!

Your tg bot can have private chats with users and group chats, getting more exposure. Moreover, once your tg bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and your prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any extra operations.

Still not excited? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, consistent with the bot on MyShell.
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when people interact with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. Choose carefully!
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Bot Workshop", click on the "System" in the edit interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task.

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram.
* If the bot name is changed on MyShell, it will also sync in TG. However, if the name is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first change will sync.
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it. TG bot will prioritize calling public bots.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegraphy and share it with others more easily. Start enjoying!
