# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to operate on your own" seems like a dream? Now, you can achieve it in just 5 minutes.

It only takes three simple steps to get your bot active on Telegram: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can start operating on Telegram by itself!

Your Telegram bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once your Telegram bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and any prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on your Telegram bot without any extra operations~

Are you not tempted yet? Come and give it a try!

## Create a Bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, just keep it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So choose carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is very important, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify Bot Message Permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to allow your bot to join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click on "Bot Settings"

4. Click on "Turn off" to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can run around the world!

If you see this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot joins a group chat, it will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go Back to MyShell and Enter Your Bot Token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click to enter the editing interface of "System", and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram
* If you change the bot's name on MyShell, it will also sync in Telegram. However, if you modify it multiple times within 5 hours, only the first modified name can be synced~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the Telegram bot will prioritize calling the public bot

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it with others more easily. **Attracting new users to register through your Telegram bot, if they meet the conditions for a valid invitation, will also count towards your valid invitations and accumulate more benefits for you in the future!**

Last but not least, you can also modify the bot's greeting message in Telegram and explain its usage. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started quickly. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit Intro" through Telegram in the bot details page\
