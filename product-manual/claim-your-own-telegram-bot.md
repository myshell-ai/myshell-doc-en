# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to run your own business." Does it sound like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it.

To make your bot active on Telegram, you only need three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can run its own business on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once the tg bot is created, it will synchronize with your bot on MyShell, and your prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any extra operations.

Are you not tempted yet? Come and give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, and keep it consistent with the bot on MyShell.
4. Give the bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be modified. So choose carefully.
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, so please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After the bot is created, just press a few buttons to let your bot join group chats and start running its business!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click on "Bot Settings"

4. Click "Turn off" to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can run around the world!

If you get to this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot joins a group chat, it will not take effect in the already joined group chats. In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop", click to enter the "System" editing interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task.

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram.
* If the bot's name is changed on MyShell, it will also be synchronized to TG. However, if the name is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first change will be synchronized.
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it with others more easily.

Lastly, you can modify the bot's greeting and usage instructions on Telegram. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit Intro" in the bot details page on Telegram.
