# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to operate on your own" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it.

Getting your bot active on Telegram only requires three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and fill in the token. Then your bot can operate on its own in Telegram!

Your tg bot can chat one-on-one with users and in groups, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once you create a tg bot, it will sync with your bot on MyShell. Any prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any extra operation from you~

Are you excited yet? Give it a try!

## Create a Bot in Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. People will frequently interact with your bot in groups using this name, and it cannot be changed. Consider it carefully~
5. The most crucial step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is essential, so please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify Bot Message Permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to let your bot join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

If you get to this interface, it means you succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot joins a group chat, it will not affect the already joined groups~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go Back to MyShell and Fill in Your Bot Token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Bot Workshop", click on the "System" in the edit interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can freely set it up on Telegram
* If the bot's name is changed on MyShell, it will also sync in TG. However, if the name is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first change will be synced~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it. The TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others.

Lastly, you can also modify the bot's greeting message in Telegram and explain its usage. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started quickly. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit Intro" in the bot details page on Telegram\
