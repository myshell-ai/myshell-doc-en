# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to run your own business." Sounds like a dream? Now, you can achieve it in just 5 minutes.

To make your bot active on Telegram, you only need three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can run its own business on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats with users and group chats, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once your tg bot is created, it will synchronize with your bot on MyShell. Any prompt changes will be reflected in real-time on your tg bot without any extra operation~

Still not tempted? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell.
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. People will frequently use this name when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. Choose carefully!
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to let your bot join group chats and start running its business!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click on "Bot Settings"

If you get to this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot has joined a group chat, it will not affect the already joined group chats~ In that case, you'll need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Return to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Robot Workshop," click on the "System" in the editing interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the process.

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram.
* If the bot's name is changed on MyShell, it will also be synchronized in TG. However, if the name is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first changed name can be synchronized.
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it. TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others.

Lastly, you can modify the bot's greeting message on Telegram and explain its usage. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click on "Edit Intro" in the bot details page on Telegram\
