# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Your bot is mature enough to start operating on its own" sounds like a dream? Now, you can achieve this in just 5 minutes.

To make your bot active on Telegram, you only need to follow these three simple steps: create bot - set permissions - fill in token, and then your bot can start operating on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once you create the tg bot, it will be synchronized with your bot on MyShell, and any changes to your prompt will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any additional operations~

Are you excited yet? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So choose wisely~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is very important, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others. &#x20;

After creating the bot, just press a few buttons to let your bot join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click on "Bot Settings"

If you get to this interface, it means you've succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot has joined a group chat, they will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and fill in your bot token

This is the last step, just go back to MyShell's "Bot Workshop", click on the "System" in the edit interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell, if needed, you can set it freely on Telegram
* If the bot name is changed on MyShell, it will also be synchronized on TG, but if it is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first changed name will be synchronized~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others. **Inviting friends to register through your tg bot will count towards your valid invitations, accumulating more benefits for you in the future!**

Last but not least, you can also modify the greeting and usage instructions for your bot on Telegram, interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started faster, the specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit Intro" in the bot details page on Telegram\
