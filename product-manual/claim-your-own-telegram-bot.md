# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to operate on your own" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it.

Getting your bot active on Telegram only requires three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can operate on its own on Telegram!

Your Telegram bot can chat one-on-one with users and participate in group chats, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once your Telegram bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and any prompt modifications will be reflected in real-time on your Telegram bot without any extra operation.

Are you not excited yet? Give it a try!

## Create a Bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot's name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell.
4. Give the bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when people interact with your bot in group chats, and it cannot be changed. So choose wisely!
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify Bot Message Permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to allow your bot to join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

4. Click "Turn off" to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can roam freely!

If you see this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot has joined a group chat, it will not take effect for the already joined group chats. In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go Back to MyShell and Enter Your Bot Token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Bot Workshop", click on the "System" in the edit interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom to complete the process.

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have a cover image from MyShell's bot. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram.
* If you change the bot's name on MyShell, it will also sync on Telegram. However, if you change it multiple times within 5 hours, only the first change will sync.
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the Telegram bot will prioritize calling the public bot.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others.

Last but not least, you can also modify the bot's greeting message on Telegram and explain its usage. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started more quickly. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit Intro" through the bot details page on Telegram.
