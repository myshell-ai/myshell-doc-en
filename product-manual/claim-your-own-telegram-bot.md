# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to operate on your own" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it.

Activating your bot on Telegram only requires three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can operate on its own on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once your tg bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and your prompt changes will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any extra operations~

Still not tempted? Come and give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, just keep it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. People will frequently use this name when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So consider it carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, simply press a few buttons to allow your bot to join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

If you get to this interface, it means you've succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot joins a group chat, it will not take effect on the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Return to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Bot Workshop", click to enter the "System" editing interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram.
* If the bot's name is changed on MyShell, it will also be synchronized in TG. However, if you change it multiple times within 5 hours, only the first name change will be synchronized~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others.

Last but not least, you can also modify the greeting message of the bot in Telegram and explain the bot's usage. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started more quickly. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click to edit in the bot details page on Telegram, then "Edit Intro"\
