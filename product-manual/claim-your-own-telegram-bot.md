# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to run your own business" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it.

It only takes three simple steps to activate your bot on Telegram: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can run its own business on Telegram!

Your tg bot can chat one-on-one with users and participate in group chats, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once you create a tg bot, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and any changes to your prompt will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any additional operations from you~

Are you not tempted yet? Come and give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot's name, just keep it consistent with the one on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when people interact with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So think carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click "Bot Settings"

If you see this interface in the end, it means you've succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy settings are set after the bot has joined the group chat, it will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Bot Workshop", click to enter the "System" edit interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram
* If you change the bot's name on MyShell, it will also sync in TG. However, if you change it multiple times within 5 hours, only the first name change will sync~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it, as the TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others.

Lastly, you can modify the bot's greeting and usage instructions in Telegram, interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click "Edit Intro" through Telegram in the bot details page\
