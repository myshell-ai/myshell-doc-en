# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to operate on your own" seems like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to achieve it.

Getting your bot active on Telegram only requires three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can operate on its own on Telegram!

Your tg bot can chat one-on-one with users and participate in group chats, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once you create your tg bot, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and any prompt changes will be reflected on the tg bot in real-time without any extra operation from you~

Can't resist the temptation? Give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the '/newbot' command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell~
4. Give your bot a simple and easy-to-read username, as it will be frequently used when interacting with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So choose carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is crucial, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After creating the bot, press a few buttons to allow your bot to join group chats and start operating!

1. Use the '/mybots' command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click on 'Bot Settings'

4. Click 'Turn off' to disable group chat privacy settings, and your bot can run freely!

If you see this interface, you've succeeded. But please note that if privacy settings are set after the bot joins a group chat, it will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Return to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step, just go back to MyShell's 'Bot Workshop', click to enter the 'System' editing interface, and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram.
* If you change the bot's name on MyShell, it will also sync to TG. However, if you change it multiple times within 5 hours, only the first name change will sync~
* If the updated bot can be public, don't forget to update it, as TG bot will prioritize calling public bots.

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it with others more easily.

Lastly, you can also modify the bot's greeting message in Telegram and explain its usage. Interesting greetings and usage introductions can help others get started faster. Here are the steps:

1. Click 'Edit Intro' in the bot details page on Telegram\
