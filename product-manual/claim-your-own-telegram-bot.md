# Claim Your Own Telegram Bot

"Being a mature bot, you should learn to run your own business" sounds like a dream? Now, you only need 5 minutes to make it happen.

To make your bot active on Telegram, you only need three simple steps: create a bot, set permissions, and enter the token. Then your bot can run its own business on Telegram!

Your tg bot can have one-on-one private chats and group chats with users, gaining more exposure. Moreover, once the tg bot is created, it will sync with your bot on MyShell, and your prompt changes will be reflected in real-time on the tg bot without any extra operation~

Are you not tempted yet? Come and give it a try!

## Create a bot at Telegram Bot Father

1. Log in to your Telegram and search for BotFather.
2. Use the "/newbot" command to start creating your bot.
3. Enter the bot's name, keeping it consistent with the bot on MyShell.
4. Give the bot a simple and easy-to-read username. This name will be frequently used when people interact with your bot in groups, and it cannot be changed. So choose carefully~
5. The most important step: copy your bot's HTTP API! This string is very important, please submit it accurately to MyShell and do not disclose it to others.

## Modify bot message permissions

After the bot is created, just press a few buttons to allow your bot to join group chats and start running!

1. Use the "/mybots" command to enter your bot management interface.
2. Click on "Bot Settings"

4. Click "Turn off" to disable the group chat privacy setting, and your bot can roam the world freely!

If you get to this interface, it means you have succeeded. However, please note that if the privacy setting is set after the bot has joined a group chat, it will not take effect for the already joined group chats~ In that case, you need to remove the bot and re-invite it!

## Go back to MyShell and enter your bot token

This is the last step. Just go back to MyShell's "Bot Workshop", click to enter the edit interface of "System", and paste the token you just copied at the bottom of the Token section to complete the task~

Please note:

* The bound bot will not have the cover image of the bot on MyShell. If needed, you can set it freely on Telegram
* If the bot's name is changed on MyShell, it will also be synchronized in TG. However, if the name is changed multiple times within 5 hours, only the first changed name can be synchronized~
* If the updated bot can be made public, don't forget to update it. TG bot will prioritize calling the public bot

Now, you can enjoy your bot on Telegram and share it more easily with others. **Inviting friends to register through your tg bot, if they meet the conditions of a valid invitation, will also count towards your valid invitations, accumulating more benefits for you in the future!**

Last but not least, you can also modify the bot's greeting and usage instructions in Telegram to help others get started faster. The specific steps are as follows:

1. Click to edit the bot's details in Telegram, then click "Edit Intro"\
