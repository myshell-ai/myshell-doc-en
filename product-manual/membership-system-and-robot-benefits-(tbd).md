# Membership System and Robot Benefits (TBD)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, where user and robot interactions consume power. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can upgrade their membership level by inviting friends or participating in community activities to gain more robot benefits. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.

### Basic (TBD)
