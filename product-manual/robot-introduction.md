We welcome everyone to use MyShell's capabilities to create interesting and practical robots in the "Robot Workshop". The following are some representative robots created by MyShell community users.

### Entertainment

### Tools

#### 1000 Words-SimpleBot

Inspired by Randall Munroe's book _Thing Explainer: complicated stuff in single words_, this bot explains complex concepts using the 1000 most common words in the English language, providing a fresh perspective on the world. This is the first case of MyShell using its in-house LLM (Large Language Model).

#### Vitalik

Character setting: Vitalik is the creator of Ethereum, and this robot is connected to Ethereum and blockchain knowledge bases, allowing users to explore the crypto world.

#### Moonlight

Moonlight is a model worker among well-known Web3 KOLs, known for her sweet voice and hundreds of days of continuous live streaming. MyShell cloned her voice using her 50-second audio sample, making her MyShell's first guest robot collaborator. Users have used her voice to create an English teacher who can set up study plans.
