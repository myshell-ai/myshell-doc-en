### Entertainment

### Tools

#### 1000 Words-SimpleBot

Inspired by Randall Munroe's book _Thing Explainer: complicated stuff in single words_, this bot uses the 1000 most common English words to explain complex concepts, offering a fresh perspective on the world. This robot is the first case of MyShell using its in-house LLM (Large Language Model).

#### Vitalik

Character setting: Vitalik is the creator of Ethereum, and this robot is connected to the Ethereum and blockchain knowledge base, allowing users to explore the crypto world.

#### Moonlight

Moonlight is a model worker among well-known Web3 KOLs, known for her sweet voice and hundreds of days of continuous live streaming. MyShell cloned her voice using a 50-second audio sample she provided, making her the first guest robot collaborator on MyShell. Users have created an English teacher who can make study plans using her voice.
