### Entertainment

### Tools

#### 1000 Words-SimpleBot

Inspired by Randall Munroe's book _Thing Explainer: complicated stuff in single words_, this robot uses the 1000 most common words in the English language to explain complex concepts, offering a fresh perspective on the world. This is the first case of MyShell using its in-house LLM (Large Language Model).

#### Vitalik

Character setting: Vitalik is the creator of Ethereum, and this robot is connected to the Ethereum and blockchain knowledge base, allowing users to explore the world of cryptocurrency.

#### Moonlight

Moonlight is a model worker among well-known Web3 KOLs, known for her sweet voice and hundreds of consecutive days of live streaming. MyShell cloned her voice using a 50-second audio sample she provided, making her the first guest robot collaborator on MyShell. Users have turned her voice into an English teacher who can create study plans.
