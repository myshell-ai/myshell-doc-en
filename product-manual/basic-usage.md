#### How to use MyShell?

Web version URL: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete functions and all Bots.

You can quickly log in with a Web3 wallet or use a Web2 account system and email, which can also easily complete the registration. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, a lightweight Demo can be experienced in the Telegram bot with the most basic Q&A function. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email + verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically assign an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. In the desktop web version, you can start recording, end recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, you can send it by clicking the enter (Enter) shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Setting. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message record but only clear the robot's memory of the current user.
