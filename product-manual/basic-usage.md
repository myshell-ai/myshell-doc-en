# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version URL: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or you can easily register using a Web2 account system or email. Note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam folder.

At the same time, a lightweight demo can also be experienced in the Telegram bot with basic Q&A functionality. Currently, the following two Bots can be experienced through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email and verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically assign an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key to start recording and end recording in sequence. After the text message is entered, it can be sent by clicking the enter (Enter) shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history of messages, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's scenario of practicing listening, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click on Text to view the original text, click on Translate to view the translation, and click on Blur again to hide the text content.
