# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version URL: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or you can easily register with a Web2 account system or email. Note that when logging in via email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, the lightweight Demo can also experience the most basic Q&A function in the Telegram bot. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers a variety of registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email and verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Dialogue

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. In the desktop web version, you can start recording, end recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, you can send it by clicking the Enter shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the historical message records, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenario, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translated text, and click Blur again to hide the text content.

#### Share (Invitation Code)
