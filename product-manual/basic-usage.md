#### How to use MyShell?

Website version: https://app.myshell.ai, the website version has the most complete functions and all Bots.

You can quickly log in with a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system, email, and easily complete the registration. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam folder.

At the same time, a lightweight demo can also be experienced in the Telegram bot with the most basic Q&A functions. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots via Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell provides multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email and verification code.

After successfully registering through a non-Web3 method, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet for the registered user.

#### Language Robot Dialogue

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, you can send it by clicking the enter (Enter) shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message records, it will only clear the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate
