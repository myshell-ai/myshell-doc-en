# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete functions and all Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system, email, and easily complete registration. Please note that when logging in via email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, the lightweight Demo can also experience the most basic Q&A function in the Telegram bot. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell provides multiple registration methods. Users can use a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or register directly via email + verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically assign an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, it can be sent by clicking the Enter shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can click the Clear Memory option in the Setting. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message records, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice usage scenarios, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translated text, and click Blur again to hide the text content.

#### Share (Invitation Code)

Inviting new users to register can upgrade the current account. After logging into the system, go to the personal profile page, enter the "Invitation Gift" window, click the Share button in the lower left corner, and the current user's share link (invitation code) will be displayed.
