# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version URL: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system, email, and easily complete the registration. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, a lightweight Demo can also be experienced in the basic Q&A function in the Telegram bot. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email + verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record, end recording, and send audio messages in sequence by clicking the spacebar (Space) shortcut key. Text messages can be sent by clicking the Enter shortcut key after input is complete.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history of message records, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenarios, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.
