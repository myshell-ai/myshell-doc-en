# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version URL: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or you can easily register using a Web2 account system or email. Please note that when logging in using email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, a lightweight Demo can also be experienced in the Telegram bot with basic question and answer functions. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots via Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email and verification code.

After successful registration through a non-Web3 method, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the Space shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, you can send it by clicking the Enter shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message record but only clear the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenarios, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can view the original text by clicking Text, view the translation by clicking Translate, and hide the text content again by clicking Blur.
