# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version URL: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system or email, and registration is just as easy. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam folder.

At the same time, a lightweight demo can also be experienced in Telegram's bot with basic Q&A functionality. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots on Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers multiple ways to register. Users can register through a web3 wallet, use a web2 account system, or directly register via email and verification code.

After successful registration via non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically assign an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language robot conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. On the desktop web version, you can start recording, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the Space key in sequence. After the text message is completed, you can send it by clicking the Enter key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the historical message records, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenario, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.
