# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all Bots.

You can quickly log in with a Web3 wallet or use a Web2 account system and email, and registration can be easily completed. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam folder.

At the same time, a lightweight demo can also be experienced in the Telegram bot with basic Q&A functions. You can currently experience the following two Bots on Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell provides multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly through email + verification code.

After successfully registering through a non-Web3 method, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet for the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. In the desktop web version, you can start recording, stop recording, and send audio messages by pressing the Space key in sequence. After the text message is entered, you can send it by pressing the Enter key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can click the Clear Memory option in the Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the historical message records, but only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenario, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.
