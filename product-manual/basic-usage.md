# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in with a Web3 wallet, or easily complete registration with a Web2 account system or email. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, a lightweight demo can also be experienced in the Telegram bot with basic Q&A functionality. Currently, the following two Bots can be experienced through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers several registration methods. Users can use a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or register directly via email and verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. In the desktop web version, you can start recording, end recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, you can send it by clicking the enter (Enter) shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history of message records but will only clear the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenario, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.

#### Share (Invitation Code)

Inviting new users to register can upgrade the current account. After logging in to the system, click the Share button in the lower-left corner to display the current user's share link (invitation code).

#### Discord Community

After logging in to the system, click the Discord button in the lower-left corner to join the Discord community.
