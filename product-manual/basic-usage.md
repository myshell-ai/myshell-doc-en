# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system, email, and easily complete the registration. It should be noted that when logging in through email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, a lightweight demo can also be experienced in the Telegram bot with the most basic Q&A functions. Currently, the following two Bots can be experienced through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers multiple registration methods. Users can use a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly register via email and verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Dialogue

Currently, text and audio messages can be sent to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record and send audio messages by successively clicking the space (Space) shortcut key to start recording, and then end recording. Text messages can be sent by pressing the enter (Enter) shortcut key after the input is completed.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Settings. It should be noted that Clear Memory will not clear the history message records, only the robot's memory of the current user will be cleared.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice usage scenarios, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.
