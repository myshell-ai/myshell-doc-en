# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system, email, and easily complete registration. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam folder.

At the same time, the lightweight Demo can also experience the most basic Q&A function in the Telegram bot. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell provides multiple registration methods. Users can use a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or register directly via email + verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Dialogue

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can start recording, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, you can send it by clicking the Enter shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Setting. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message record, but only clear the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice usage scenarios, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can view the original text by clicking Text, view the translation by clicking Translate, and click Blur again to hide the text content.

#### Share (Invitation Code)

Inviting new users to register can upgrade the current account. After logging in to the system, go to the personal profile page, enter the "Invitation Gift" window, and click the Share button in the lower left corner to display the current user's share link (invitation code).
