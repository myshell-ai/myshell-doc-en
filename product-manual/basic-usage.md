# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete functions and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system, email, and easily complete the registration. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, a lightweight demo can also be experienced in the Telegram bot with the most basic question and answer function. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots on Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell provides multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email + verification code.

After successfully registering through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Conversations with Language Bots

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. On the desktop web version, you can start recording, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the Space key in sequence. After the text message is entered, you can send it by clicking the Enter key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the historical message records, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice usage scenario, the Bot's reply is set to Blur status by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.

#### Share (Invitation Code)

Inviting new users to register can upgrade the current account. After logging in to the system, click the Share button in the lower left corner to display the current user's share link (invitation code).

#### Discord Community

After logging in to the system, click the Discord button in the lower left corner to join the Discord community.
