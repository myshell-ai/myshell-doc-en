# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version URL: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete functions and all Bots.

You can quickly log in with a Web3 wallet, or easily register with a Web2 account system and email. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, the lightweight Demo can also experience the most basic Q&A function in the Telegram bot. The following two Bots can currently be experienced through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell provides multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email + verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, text and audio messages can be sent to robots. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, it can be sent by pressing the Enter shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can click on the Clear Memory option in the Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message record, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenarios, the Bot's reply is set to Blur status by default. You can click on Text to view the original text, click on Translate to view the translation, and click on Blur again to hide the text content.
