# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in using a Web3 wallet or easily register with a Web2 account system or email. Please note that when logging in with email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, a lightweight demo with basic Q&A functionality can also be experienced in the Telegram bot. Currently, you can experience the following two Bots through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email and verification code.

After successful registration by non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key to start recording and ending recording. Text messages can be sent by pressing the Enter key after input is complete.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message record, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenario, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.
