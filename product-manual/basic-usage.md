# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in with a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system and email, and you can also easily complete registration. It should be noted that when logging in with an email method, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam folder.

At the same time, a lightweight demo of the basic Q&A function can also be experienced in the Telegram bot. Currently, the following two Bots can be experienced through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email and verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Dialogue

Currently, text and audio messages can be sent to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, it can be sent by clicking the Enter shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can do so by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Settings. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message records, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice scenarios, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.

Inviting new users to register can upgrade the current account. After logging into the system, click the Share button in the lower left corner to display the current user's share link (invitation code).

#### Discord Community
