# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete functions and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in with a Web3 wallet or use a Web2 account system and email, which can also easily complete the registration. Please note that when using the email method to log in, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam box.

At the same time, a lightweight Demo can also be experienced in the Telegram bot with the most basic Q&A functions. Currently, the following two Bots can be experienced through Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell provides multiple registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly via email + verification code.

After successfully registering through a non-Web3 method, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language Robot Conversation

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the maximum duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can record, stop recording, and send audio messages by clicking the Space shortcut key in sequence. After completing the text message input, you can send it by clicking the Enter shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can click the Clear Memory option in the Setting. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message records, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice usage scenarios, the Bot's reply is set to Blur by default. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again to hide the text content.
