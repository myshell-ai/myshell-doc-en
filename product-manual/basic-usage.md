# Basic Usage

#### How to use MyShell?

Web version address: https://app.myshell.ai, the web version has the most complete features and all the Bots.

You can quickly log in with a Web3 wallet, or use a Web2 account system and email, which can also be easily registered. Please note that when logging in with an email, the verification code may be intercepted in the spam folder.

At the same time, the lightweight demo can also experience the most basic Q&A function in the Telegram bot. Currently, the following two Bots can be experienced on Telegram:

* Samantha: [https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot](https://t.me/samantha\_x64\_bot)
* Sherlock: [https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot](https://t.me/sherlock\_myshell\_ai\_bot)

#### Registration

MyShell offers various registration methods. Users can register through a web3 wallet, a web2 account system, or directly through email and verification code.

After successful registration through non-Web3 methods, the system will automatically allocate an ETH custodial wallet to the registered user.

#### Language robot dialogue

Currently, you can send text and audio messages to the robot. The maximum length of text messages is limited to 500 characters, and the longest duration of audio messages is limited to 90 seconds. The desktop web version can start recording, end recording, and send audio messages by clicking the space (Space) shortcut key in sequence. After the text message is entered, it can be sent by clicking the Enter shortcut key.

#### Clear Memory

If you want to reset the Bot, you can operate by clicking the Clear Memory option in the Setting. Please note that Clear Memory will not clear the history message record, only the robot's memory of the current user.

#### Blur, Text, Translate

To meet the user's listening practice usage scenarios, the Bot's reply defaults to the Blur state. You can click Text to view the original text, click Translate to view the translation, and click Blur again, and the text content will be hidden again.

#### Share (Invitation Code)

Inviting new users to register can upgrade the current account. After logging in to the system, enter the "Invitation Gift" window in the personal profile page, click the Share button in the lower-left corner, and the current user's sharing link (invitation code) will be displayed.

#### Discord Community

After logging in to the system, click the "Community" button in the personal profile page to join the Discord community.
