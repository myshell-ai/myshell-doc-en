# Membership System and Robot Benefits (Beta)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, where user interaction with robots consumes power. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation of robots in the Robot Workshop.

MyShell memberships are divided into 3 categories: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass. Higher-level members can enjoy more robot benefits.
