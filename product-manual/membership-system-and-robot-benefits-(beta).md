# Membership System and Robot Benefits (Beta)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, where users need to consume power to interact with robots. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery speeds, as well as higher privileges in participating in robot workshops.

MyShell's memberships are divided into 3 categories: Basic Battle Pass, Standard Battle Pass, and Genesis Pass. Higher-level members can enjoy more robot benefits.
