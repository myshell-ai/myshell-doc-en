# Membership System and Robot Benefits (Beta)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system. User interaction with robots requires power consumption. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in creating robots in the Robot Workshop.

MyShell's memberships are divided into 3 categories: Regular Members, Advanced Members, and Genesis Passes, each corresponding to different robot benefits.
