# Membership System and Robot Benefits (Beta)

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, and user interaction with robots requires power consumption. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher privileges to participate in the creation of the Robot Workshop.

MyShell's memberships are divided into 3 categories: regular members, advanced members, and Genesis Passes, each corresponding to different robot benefits.
