# MyShell Points System (Beta)

The MyShell Points System is a member incentive system designed to ensure that MyShell users can earn more benefits while learning and entertaining on the platform. The season rules are as follows:

* We will refresh tasks and rewards according to the points season system. Each season lasts for about 15 days, with tasks and season changes based on the UTC-4 timezone.
* **The first 12 days of each season are the points earning period**, during which users can earn massive points by completing tasks. Task types include daily conversations, MyShell feature experiences, educational bot cumulative check-ins, participating in social media, and inviting new users.
* **The last 3 days of each season are the points redemption period**, during which points earning will be temporarily suspended. Users can redeem the points earned each season for various rewards, including power cards, standard battle pass cards, and even Genesis passes. Remaining points can also be used to redeem unique medals for each season, which may have unexpected uses in the future~ Please note that unused points will be cleared at the end of the season.

### S1 Season: 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4)

* Standard battle pass cards are free for a limited time. We hope that everyone can enjoy the free benefits while earning more member benefits for themselves.
* Reward redemption: S1 limited edition blind box (randomly get power cards, 1-3 month standard battle pass cards, or Genesis passes), 1-month standard battle pass card, Genesis pass, and S1 medal.

### S2 Season: 2023-07-16 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-31 23:59 (UTC-4)
