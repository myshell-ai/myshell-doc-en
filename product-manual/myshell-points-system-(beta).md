# MyShell Points System (Beta)

The MyShell Points System is a membership incentive system designed to ensure that MyShell users can earn more benefits while learning and having fun on the platform. The season rules are as follows:

* We will refresh tasks and rewards according to the points season system. Each season lasts about 15 days and follows the UTC-4 time zone for task refreshes and season changes.
* **The first 12 days of each season are the points earning period**, during which users can earn massive points by completing tasks. Task types include: daily conversations, MyShell feature experiences, educational bot cumulative check-ins, participating in social media, and inviting new users.
* **The last 3 days of each season are the points redemption period**, during which point earning will be temporarily suspended. Users can exchange the points earned in each season for various rewards, including energy cards, standard battle pass cards, and even genesis passes. Remaining points can also be exchanged for unique medals for each season, which may have unexpected uses in the future~ Please note that unused points will be cleared at the end of the season.

### S1 Season: 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4)

* Standard battle pass cards are globally free, and we hope that everyone can enjoy the free benefits while earning more membership benefits for themselves.
* Reward exchange: S1 limited blind box (randomly get energy cards, 1-3 months standard battle pass cards, or genesis passes), 1-month standard battle pass card, genesis pass, and S1 medal.

### S2 Season: 2023-07-16 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-31 23:59 (UTC-4)
