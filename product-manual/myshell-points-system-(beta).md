# MyShell Points System (Beta)

MyShell Points System is a membership incentive system designed to ensure that MyShell users can earn more benefits while learning and having fun on the platform. The season rules are as follows:

* We will refresh tasks and rewards according to the points season system. Each season lasts for about 15 days, with tasks and season changes happening according to the UTC-4 timezone.
* **The first 12 days of each season are the points earning period**, during which users can earn a large number of points by completing tasks. Task types include: daily conversations, MyShell feature experiences, education bot cumulative check-ins, participating in social media, inviting new users, etc.
* **The last 3 days of each season are the points redemption period**, during which points earning will be temporarily stopped. Users can exchange the points they earned in each season for various rewards, including energy cards, standard battle pass cards, and even genesis passes. Remaining points can also be exchanged for unique medals for each season, which may have unexpected uses in the future~ Please note that unused points will be cleared at the end of the season.

### S1 Season: 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4)

* Standard battle pass cards are globally free for a limited time. We hope that everyone can enjoy the free benefits while earning more membership benefits for themselves.
* Reward Exchange: S1 limited edition blind box (randomly get energy cards, 1-3 month standard battle pass cards, or genesis passes), 1-month standard battle pass card, genesis pass, and S1 medal.

### S2 Season: 2023-07-16 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-31 23:59 (UTC-4)

* More task types and rewards are coming soon! Stay tuned!
