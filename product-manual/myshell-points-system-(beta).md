# MyShell Points System (Beta)

The MyShell Points System is a membership incentive program designed to ensure that MyShell users can earn more benefits while learning and having fun on the platform. The season rules are as follows:

* We will refresh tasks and rewards according to the points season system. Each season lasts about 15 days, with tasks and season changes occurring according to the UTC-4 timezone.
* **The first 12 days of each season are the points earning period**. Users can earn massive points by completing tasks, including daily conversations, MyShell feature experiences, accumulating check-ins with education bots, participating in social media, and inviting new users.
* **The last 3 days of each season are the points redemption period**. Points earning will be temporarily suspended, and users can exchange the points earned in each season for various rewards, including energy cards, standard battle pass cards, and even Genesis passes. Remaining points can also be exchanged for unique season medals, which may have unexpected uses in the future~ Please note that unused points will be cleared at the end of the season.

### S1 Season: 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4)

* Standard battle pass cards are globally free for a limited time. We hope everyone can enjoy the free benefits while earning more membership privileges for themselves.
* Reward exchange: S1 limited edition blind box (randomly receive energy cards, 1-3 month standard battle pass cards, or Genesis passes), 1-month standard battle pass card, Genesis pass, and S1 medal.

### S2 Season: 2023-07-16 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-31 23:59 (UTC-4)
