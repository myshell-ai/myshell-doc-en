# MyShell Points System (Beta)

The MyShell Points System is a membership incentive program designed to ensure that MyShell users can earn more benefits while learning and having fun on the platform. Season rules are as follows:

* We will follow a points season system for task refresh and reward refresh, with each season lasting approximately 15 days, and task refresh and season changeover taking place according to the UTC-4 timezone.
* **The first 12 days of each season are the points earning period**, during which users can earn a large number of points by completing tasks, including: daily conversations, MyShell feature experiences, cumulative check-ins with educational bots, participating in social media, and inviting new users.
* **The last 3 days of each season are the points redemption period**, during which points earning will be temporarily suspended, and users can redeem rewards with the points earned in each season, including energy cards, standard battle pass cards, and even Genesis passes. Remaining points can also be used to exchange for unique medals for each season, which may have unexpected uses in the future~ Please note that unused points will be cleared at the end of the season.

### S1 Season: 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4)

* Standard battle pass cards are free globally, and we hope that everyone can enjoy the free benefits while earning more membership benefits for themselves.
* Reward redemption: S1 exclusive blind box (randomly obtain energy cards, 1-3 month standard battle pass cards, or Genesis passes), 1-month standard battle pass card, Genesis pass, and S1 medal.
