# MyShell Points System (Beta)

The MyShell Points System is a membership incentive system designed to ensure that MyShell users can earn more benefits while learning and entertaining on the platform. The season rules are as follows:

* We will follow a points season system for task refresh and rewards refresh. Each season lasts about 15 days, with tasks and seasons refreshed according to the UTC-4 timezone.
* **The first 12 days of each season are the points earning period**, during which users can earn massive points by completing tasks, including: daily conversations, MyShell feature experiences, educational bot accumulated check-ins, participating in social media, inviting new users, etc.
* **The last 3 days of each season are the points redemption period**, during which points earning will be temporarily suspended, and users can exchange the points earned in each season for various rewards, including energy cards, premium membership cards, and even Genesis Passes. Remaining points can also be exchanged for unique season badges, which serve as proof for receiving future airdrops. Please note that unused points will be cleared at the end of the season.

### S1 Season: 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4)

* Premium membership cards are globally free of charge. We hope that everyone can enjoy the benefits of the free membership while earning more membership benefits for themselves.
* Rewards redemption:
  1. Genesis Pass: Creator benefits, more private robots, public robot privileges, creation support using GPT-4 model, and more benefits! (For those who get the Genesis Pass, please be patient, we will cast the Pass and transfer it to your account within 7 days)
  2. Premium Membership Card (1 month): Can be exchanged for a 1-month premium membership (stackable) after the membership payment is activated (expected within three months), suitable for non-creator ordinary users.
  3. S1 Commemorative Medal: Season-exclusive medal, soon to be minted as an NFT, can be used as proof for receiving future airdrops.
  4. GPT-4 Chat Pack (600 energy/300 energy/150 energy): Can be used as a one-time charging item, can exceed the energy limit, especially suitable for scenarios requiring extensive use of GPT-4.

### S2 Season: 2023-07-16 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-31 23:59 (UTC-4)

* Stay tuned for more task types and rewards!
