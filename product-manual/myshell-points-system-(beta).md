# MyShell Points System (Beta)

The MyShell Points System is a membership incentive program designed to ensure that MyShell users can earn more benefits while learning and having fun on the platform. The season rules are as follows:

* We will follow a points season system for task refresh and reward refresh. Each season lasts around 15 days, with tasks and season changes based on the UTC-4 timezone.
* **The first 12 days of each season are for earning points**. Users can earn a large number of points by completing tasks, including daily conversations, MyShell feature experiences, education bot cumulative check-ins, participating in social media, and inviting new users.
* **The last 3 days of each season are for points redemption**. Points earning will be temporarily suspended, and users can redeem the points earned in each season for various rewards, including power cards, standard battle pass cards, and even Genesis passes. Remaining points can also be exchanged for season-specific medals, which may have unexpected uses in the future\~ Please note that unused points will be cleared at the end of the season.

### S1 Season: 2023-07-01 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-15 23:59 (UTC-4)

* Standard battle pass cards are globally free for a limited time. We hope everyone can enjoy the free benefits while earning more membership benefits for themselves.
* Reward redemption: S1 limited edition blind box (randomly get power cards, 1-3 month standard battle pass cards, or Genesis passes), 1-month standard battle pass card, Genesis pass, and S1 medal.

### S2 Season: 2023-07-16 0:00 (UTC-4) - 2023-07-31 23:59 (UTC-4)

* Stay tuned for more task types and rewards!
