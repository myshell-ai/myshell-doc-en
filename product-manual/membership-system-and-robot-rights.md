# Membership System and Robot Rights

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, where user interactions with robots consume power. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in creating robots in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can upgrade their membership level by inviting friends or obtaining a MyShell Pass NFT, gaining more robot rights. There are two routes to upgrade your membership level, and users with a MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
