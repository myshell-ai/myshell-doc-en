# Membership System and Robot Rights

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, and user interaction with robots requires the consumption of power. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher privileges for participating in the creation of robots in Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can increase their membership level by inviting friends, obtaining MyShell Pass NFT, and gaining more robot rights. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
