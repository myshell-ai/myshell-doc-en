# Membership System and Robot Rights

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is tied to the power system, where users interact with robots and consume power. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in creating robots in the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can invite friends, obtain MyShell Pass NFT to upgrade their membership level, and gain more robot rights. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
