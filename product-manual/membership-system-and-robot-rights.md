# Membership System and Robot Rights

## Membership System

MyShell's membership system is bound to the power system, and user interaction with robots requires power consumption. Higher-level members have higher power limits and recovery rates, as well as higher permissions to participate in the creation of the Robot Workshop.

Any MyShell user can invite friends and obtain MyShell Pass NFT to upgrade their membership level and gain more robot rights. There are two routes to upgrade membership levels, and users with MyShell Genesis Pass start at Lv.3.
