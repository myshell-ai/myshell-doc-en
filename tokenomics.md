# Tokenomics

### Overview

### NFT

#### PassCard NFT

* User's NFT
* Regular membership credentials, users who own this credential can participate in our encrypted economic system, divided into Genesis PassCard NFT (limited to 10,000) and member PassCard; Genesis PassCard enjoys more platform rights;

#### Shell NFT

* NFT for robot creators
* The concept is inspired by "Ghost in the Shell"
* Today, with the massive explosion of AI large models, second-layer models, and fine-tuned models, we view each type of model as a Lego block with infinite possibilities for combination and meeting various niche market demands. Additionally, the asset characteristics of consuming computing power to produce value align perfectly with the concept of NFT as an asset container.

Shell NFT and Passcard NFT are ERC 721 tokens, and their purposes and acquisition methods are as follows.

Design Objectives:

1. Solve the incentive problem for user growth.
2. Solve the incentive problem for Bot providers.
